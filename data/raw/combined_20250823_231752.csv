The study was based on social cognition theory and a sample of 277 Israeli middle leaders from public elementary and secondary schools. The data were analysed using SPSS and the PROCESS macro. The findings indicate that support for GenAI positively influences both GenAI self-efficacy and valuing but only GenAI self-efficacy emerged as a significant mediator. The results expand the limited empirical scholarship on AI in school leadership, most of which is non-empirical. The results suggest that middle leaders’ confidence in their ability to use GenAI plays a critical role in their engagement with the technology and that organisational support helps promote GenAI adoption. Middle leaders’ GenAI self-efficacy was shown to play a key role in channelling the beneficial effect of school support on integration in practice. The results and their implications are discussed.</jats:p>"

The research employs a questionnaire-based approach, collecting responses from 439 participants and examining demographics, technological proficiency, utility perceptions, personal data concerns, attitudes towards artificial intelligence and generative artificial intelligence, and willingness to endorse technology adoption. The data analysis minimises discrepancies between predicted and actual values through multiple linear regression. In addition, statistical methods such as Spearman’s ρ, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test and chi-square statistics are employed to consolidate the findings, ensuring the thoroughness and validity of the research process. The results indicate a positive inclination among participants to perceive artificial intelligence as augmentative rather than a replacement in public usage contexts. The research’s originality lies in the unique contribution of employees to technology adoption and strategic knowledge asset renewal for the management in the public domain. </jats:p>"

Adaptive cancer therapy is in principle the most viable approach to manage cancer’s adaptive dynamics through drug combinations with dose timing and modulation. However, there are numerous open issues facing the clinical success of adaptive therapy. Chief among these issues is the feasibility of real-time predictions of treatment response which represent a bedrock requirement of adaptive therapy. Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to learn prediction models of treatment response from clinical, molecular, and radiomics data about patients and their treatments. The article explores this potential through a proposed integration model of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) in a closed loop with adaptive treatments to predict the trajectories of disease progression. The conceptual model and the challenges facing its realization are discussed in the broader context of artificial intelligence integration in oncology. </jats:p>"

            Image colorization is one of the core issues in computer vision that has attracted significant attention in recent years. Colorization technique improves the human eye’s ability to recognize grayscale images and understand scenes, particularly in low-light-level (LLL) images. However, current colorization methods still face issues, such as semantic confusion, color bleeding, and loss of image details. To address these issues, a bi-stream feature extraction and multiscale attention generative adversarial network (BM-GAN) is proposed. The bi-stream feature extraction block combines global and local features extracted from two parallel encoders. This combination improves the ability of the network to extract deep features from images. The multiscale attention block enhances key features related to the colorization target across channels and spatial dimensions. This results in higher-quality color images. The proposed method is evaluated on ImageNet, Summer2winter validation set, and LLL images. Experimental results show that BM-GAN reduces the feature-aware evaluation metrics learned perceptual image patch similarity and Fréchet inception distance by 5.2% and 7.5%, respectively.

The rise to prominence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in many realms of human activities is compelling the consideration of its capabilities as a potential lever to advance the development of effective cancer treatments. This article presents a hypothetical case study on the application of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) to the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). The case explores the design of GPT-supported adaptive intermittent therapy for mPC. Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are assumed to be repeatedly monitored while treatment may involve a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), androgen receptor-signalling inhibitors (ARSI), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The analysis covers various questions relevant to the configuration, training, and inferencing of GPTs for the case of mPC treatment with a particular attention to risk mitigation regarding the hallucination problem and its implications to clinical integration of GenAI technologies. The case study provides elements of an actionable pathway to the realization of GenAI-assisted adaptive treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. As such, the study is expected to help facilitate the design of clinical trials of GenAI-supported cancer treatments. </jats:p>"

This article asks: have GLMs acquired natural language? Employing Gadamer’s theory of language, I argue that they have not. While GLMs can reliably generate linguistic content that can be interpreted as “texts,” they lack the linguistically mediated reality that language provides. Missing from these models are four key features of a linguistic construction of reality: groundedness to the world, understanding, community, and tradition. I conclude with skepticism that GLMs can ever achieve natural language because they lack these characteristics in their linguistic development. </jats:p>"

Its focal point is Generative AI, a technology that puts so-called Large Language Models to work. The first part of the paper analyzes Generative AI, based as it is on the statistical probability of one token (a word or part of a word) following another. If the relation of tokens is meaningful, this is circumstantial and no more, because its mechanisms of statistical analysis eschew any theory of meaning. This is the case not only for the written text that Generative AI leverages, but by extension image and multimodal forms of meaning that it can generate. The AI can only work with non-textual forms of meaning after applying language labels, and to that extent is captive not only to the limits of probabilistic statistics but the limits of written language as well. While acknowledging gains arising from the brute statistical power of Generative AI, in its second part the paper goes on to map what is lost in its statistical and text-bound approaches to multimodal meaning-making. Our measure of these gains and losses is guided by the concept of grammar, defined here as a theory of the elemental patterns of meaning in the world—not just written text and speech, but also image, space, object, body, and sound. Ironically, a good deal of what is lost by Generative AI is computable. The third and final part of the paper briefly discusses educational applications of Generative AI. Given both its power and intrinsic limitations, we have been experimenting with the application of Generative AI in educational settings and the ways it might be put to pedagogical use. How does a grammatical analysis help us to identify the scope of worthwhile application?

Importantly, consumers are generally unable to distinguish responses generated by GenAI from human responses. However, transparency about GenAI use significantly alters consumer perceptions, often negatively, but this negative effect varies depending on the source of disclosure and consumers’ subjective knowledge about GenAI. We discuss the implications for consumer privacy, welfare, and public policy, emphasizing the need for transparent GenAI use in customer service, especially within sensitive sectors like healthcare.</jats:p>"

While the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model has been widely applied to various technologies, its applicability to generative artificial intelligence products, which present unique challenges and opportunities, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective strategies for promoting user acceptance and optimising the design of generative artificial intelligence tools. This study extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to investigate the factors influencing usage intention for generative artificial intelligence products. The study incorporates additional variables such as digital literacy, perceived risk and perceived trust to provide a more comprehensive framework. Using structural equation modelling to analyse survey data, the study found that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and perceived trust significantly and positively impact usage intention. In addition, digital literacy indirectly enhances usage intention through effort expectancy, while perceived risk negatively influences usage intention through reduced trust. Notably, facilitating conditions did not exhibit a significant effect on usage intention. These findings offer valuable insights for developers and researchers in the field of generative artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of user-friendly design, performance optimisation, and trust-building measures. By identifying key factors that drive user adoption, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of technology acceptance in the context of advanced artificial intelligence systems, paving the way for more effective development and implementation strategies in this rapidly evolving field. </jats:p>"

This study aims to explore determinants of AI hallucination exposure (HEX), examine the potential HEX's direct and mediating effects on adoption intentions, and integrate HEX into the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to advance generative AI adoption models. An eight-factor measurement model, grounded in the TPB and incorporating constructs such as perceived usefulness, attitude toward AI, perceived risk, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, user trust, AI hallucination exposure, and behavioral intention, was developed and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The study concludes that perceived behavioral control is a significant determinant of AI hallucination exposure (HEX), while subjective norms exert a direct influence on behavioral intention (BI) to adopt generative AI chatbots. AI hallucination exposure does not statistically significantly mediate the relationship between key antecedents and the use of generative AI chatbots. These findings advance the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by integrating AI-specific risks like HEX while underscoring the need to refine theoretical models to account for contexts where technological reliability—rather than user perceptions alone—drives adoption decisions.</jats:p>"

The study aims to identify the factors influencing AI literacy and its subsequent influence on consumers’ behavioral intentions toward seeking health information using generative AI chatbots. A nine-factor measurement model (INS, ISE, IFO, AIH, ANX, AVD, AIL, BI, AIC) was developed with the help of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and tested using structural equation modeling. The results of SEM analysis demonstrate that IFO (β = 0.138, CR = 2.731, p &lt; .05), ANX (β = 0.175, CR = 3.103, p &lt; .05), and AVD (β = 0.158, CR = 3.855, p &lt; .05) had a statistically positive significant influence on AI literacy. Similarly, BI (β = 0.128, CR = 2.423, p &lt; .05) had a statistically positive significant influence on AIC. A positive but non-significant effect of INS on AIL was also observed (β=0.058, CR = 1.006, p &gt; .05). AIL also had a positive but non-significant effect on BI (β=0.050, CR = 1.598, p &gt; .05).

To address this research gap, this study systematically reviews the literature on GenAI in special education. Specifically, it conducts a meta-synthesis of thirty-three studies based on Vygotsky's mediated-action model. The obtained results revealed that: (a) most of the studies on GenAI in special education are from the U.S. and the most targeted disability type is emotion/attention; (b) GenAI was mostly used as a pedagogical assistant; (c) although a quantitative synthesis on experimental studies indicated a huge effect (

To counter AI-fueled misinformation, we argue that the development of ethical AI necessitates regulations from AI practitioners and legislation, and ethical uses of AI require efforts in AI literacy education and research. The AI literacy should include (a) users’ understanding and critical evaluation of knowledge, values, and cultures within which AI systems function, and their implications on the AI-generated content, (b) users’ strategic interpretation and proper use of AI-generated content, and (c) users’ utilization of feedback mechanisms to promote institutional management of the AI power. </jats:p>"

Market researchers, social scientists, policymakers, government entities, public health researchers, and practitioners recognize the potential for social data to inspire innovation, support products and services, characterize public opinion, and guide decisions. The appeal of mining these rich datasets is clear. However, there is potential risk of data misuse, underscoring an equally huge and fundamental flaw in the research: there are no procedural standards and little transparency. Transparency across the processes of collecting and analyzing social media data is often limited due to proprietary algorithms. Spurious findings and biases introduced by artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate the challenges this lack of transparency poses for research. Social media research remains a virtual “wild west,” with no clear standards for reporting regarding data retrieval, preprocessing steps, analytic methods, or interpretation. Use of emerging generative AI technologies to augment social media analytics can undermine validity and replicability of findings, potentially turning this research into a “black box” enterprise. Clear guidance for social media analyses and reporting is needed to assure the quality of the resulting research. In this article, we propose criteria for evaluating the quality of studies using social media data, grounded in established scientific practice. We offer clear documentation guidelines to ensure that social data are used properly and transparently in research and applications. A checklist of disclosure elements to meet minimal reporting standards is proposed. These criteria will make it possible for scholars and practitioners to assess the quality, credibility, and comparability of research findings using digital data. </jats:p>"

            The use of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) to assist college students in their studies has become a trend. However, there is no academic consensus on whether Gen-AI can enhance the academic achievement of college students. Using a meta-analytic approach, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Gen-AI in improving the academic achievement of college students and to explore the effects of different moderating variables. A total of 28 articles (65 independent studies, 1909 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this study. The results showed that Gen-AI significantly improved college students’ academic achievement with a medium effect size (Hedges’s

Fundamental to the diagnosis and clinical surveillance is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows for the identification of T2-hyperintensities associated with autoimmune injury that demonstrate distinct spatial distribution patterns. Here, we describe the clinical experience of a 31-year-old, right-handed, White man seen in consultation at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, following complaints of headaches that began after head trauma related to military service. Imaging data spanning over 10 years are provided. All MRI data are currently presented in black and white with grayscale values within voxels associated with a single variable, intensity. We transformed these grayscale values into color using generative artificial intelligence (AI). As color allows for the inclusion of three variables: hue, lightness (intensity), and saturation, we hypothesized that additional details may be learned beyond those currently provided with the existing conventional approach of grayscale interpretation. We identified differences in lesion colors that remained consistent from the two MRI timepoints studied. In addition, quantitative R1, R2, and proton density voxel values appeared consistent with the color scheme generated by the AI system. With advancing AI methods and capabilities along with the additional data that color provides in comparison to grayscale, new insights into the biology of disease may be possible. Modifying what we measure in people with chronic conditions and how we present the data may be of greater value than conventional approaches typically used in the study, education, and care of people with MS and other neurological conditions. </jats:p>"

To address this, the

The survey comprised 12 items, among those assessing the role of GenAI for students and educators, the need to modify teaching approaches, GenAI’s perceived advantages, applications of GenAI in the educational context, and the concerns, challenges, and trustworthiness associated with GenAI. Responses were obtained from 48 faculty. They showed a positive attitude toward GenAI and disagreed on GenAI having a very negative effect on either the students’ or faculty’s educational experience. Eighty-five percent of our medical schools’ faculty responded to had heard about GenAI, while 42% had not used it at all. Generating text (33%), automating repetitive tasks (19%), and creating multimedia content (17%) were some of the common utilizations of GenAI by school faculty.

As AI technologies develop, it becomes more important to investigate these new technologies as a subject to be included in educational levels. The contribution of AI to success in educational settings is closely linked to the preparation of teachers. On the other hand, AI is an important concept that should be learnt by all students regardless of their educational level. Therefore, it is important to understand how prepared future teachers are for AI learning to ensure the effective implementation of AI in schools. Furthermore, addressing the perceived threats and digital citizenship levels arising from the use of emerging AI-based technologies requires individuals to have effective AI-related knowledge, skills and values. The aim of this study is to reveal the relationship between pre-service teachers’ AI readiness levels and various variables. These variables are perceived threats from AI, AI-enhanced innovation, AI literacy, digital citizenship. A total of 816 pre-service teachers participated in the study. PLS-SEM was used to evaluate the relationships between the research variables. In addition, Multigroup Analysis (MGA) was applied to model sub-samples according to gender. It was found that AI-enhanced innovation levels were significantly affected by the dimensions of AI readiness: cognition, vision and ethics in teaching. Perceived threats from AI level was significantly affected by ability and ethics in teaching, which are the dimensions of AI readiness. Perceived threats from AI levels had a significant effect on AI literacy. AI-enhanced innovation was found to have a significant effect on AI literacy and digital citizenship. In addition, differences were found according to gender. The results of this study can also guide pre-professional development programs to be developed for pre-service teachers, which is an important factor to be considered in AI education.</jats:p>"

A meta-analysis of 49 articles showed that the mean effect sizes of GenAI on students’ learning achievement and learning motivation were 0.857 and 0.803, respectively, indicating a positive impact of GenAI on education. However, this effect varied according to moderators, including education level, subject classification, GenAI interface, GenAI development, interaction approaches, and experimentation time, which enhanced the impact of GenAI on education. Specifically, GenAI had a greater impact on the academic performance of higher education students, and students interacted more effectively with GenAI using text than with mixed media, such as images or audio.

            <jats:bold>Rationale and Objectives:</jats:bold>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly generative models, are increasingly used to depict clinical roles in healthcare. This study evaluates whether generative AI systems accurately differentiate between radiologists and medical radiation technologists (MRTs), 2 roles often confused by patients and providers.
            <jats:bold>Materials and Methods:</jats:bold>
            We assessed 1380 images and videos generated by 8 text-to-image/video AI models. Five raters evaluated task-role accuracy, attire, equipment, lighting, isolation, and demographics. Statistical tests compared differences across models and roles.
            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>
            MRTs were depicted accurately in 82.0% of outputs, while only 56.2% of radiologist images/videos were role-appropriate. Among inaccurate radiologist depictions, 79.1% misrepresented MRTs tasks. Radiologists were more often male (73.8%) and White (79.7%), while MRTs were more diverse. Stethoscope misuse, lack of disability/religious markers, and overuse of business attire for radiologists further reflected bias.
            <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>
            Generative AI frequently misrepresents radiologist roles and demographics, reinforcing stereotypes and public confusion. Greater oversight and inclusion standards are needed to ensure equitable AI-generated healthcare content.

We developed a 13-question survey using the REDCap application to explore participants’ educational background, year in school, preferred medical specialty, and perception of current or potential use of GenAI within residency applications. More than half of the responders have already used or plan to use GenAI for assistance in developing their personal statements for their applications. A considerable percentage (43.3%) will use GenAI to edit/modify a draft of the personal statement. More than half of survey participants believe that in the future, GenAI may alter the significance program directors place on letters of recommendation (LORs) in their selection criteria for deciding who to interview and select. Our survey results indicate that a number of students are either using or are receptive to the idea of using GenAI to draft or refine certain components of their residency application, such as the personal statement and impactful experiences section.

Combining qualitative and quantitative content analysis, we find that, generally, ChatGPT portrays science largely as the STEM disciplines, in a positivist-empiricist way and a positive light. When comparing ChatGPT’s responses to different simulated user profiles and responses from the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions, we find similarities in that the scientific consensus on questions such as climate change, COVID-19 vaccinations, or astrology is consistently conveyed across them.

In recent years, many systems have been proposed to address this integration in a seemingly efficient manner. However, from the computational perspective, this is in principle impossible to do. Specifically, some of the core symbolic problems are provably hard, hence a general NSI system necessarily needs to adopt this computational complexity, too.

            Generative artificial intelligence (Gen.AI) is capable of significantly improving the breadth and depth of structured literature reviews (SLRs). However, its inclusion raises essential questions regarding the review’s methodology, quality, and ethical implications. Previous research predominantly focused on the capabilities and limitations of Gen.AI to establish guidelines for research practices. However, the rapid evolution of Gen.AI often outpaces the publication of methodological papers. In response, our study adopts a criteria-centric approach, scrutinizing the scientific quality standards that Gen.AI must meet. In other words, instead of discussing
            <jats:italic>what Gen.AI can and cannot do</jats:italic>

From this, we synthesize a unified process and criterion set, not only underpinning a comprehensive understanding of the extant SLR methodologies but also serving as the foundational framework for integrating Gen.AI. Second, we delineate the specific scenarios conducive to incorporating Gen.AI into this fundamental framework, as well as situations where its integration may not be suitable. Our contribution is further solidified by providing a detailed, step-by-step guide—akin to a “cooking recipe”—to effectively integrate Gen.AI in SLRs, ensuring adherence to established quality criteria.

The aim is to offer AI systems the ability to learn from human revision but also assist humans at evaluating AI capabilities. The proposed method allows users and domain experts to learn about the data-driven decision making process of large neural network models and to impose a particular behaviour onto such models. The models are queried using a symbolic logic language that acts as a lingua franca between humans and model representations. Interaction with the user then confirms or rejects a revision of the model using logical constraints that can be distilled back into the neural network. We illustrate the approach using the Logic Tensor Network framework alongside Concept Activation Vectors and apply it to Convolutional Neural Networks and the task of achieving quantitative fairness. Our results illustrate how the use of a logical language is able to provide users with a formalisation of the model’s decision making whilst allowing users to steer the model towards a given alignment constraint.</jats:p>

It explored how factors like learners’ ideal L2 self-imagination, international posture, and perceptions of information quality influence their engagement with productive (e.g., writing, speaking) and receptive (e.g., reading, listening) informal digital learning activities mediated by generative AI. Drawing from theories of consumption values and self-determination, the research model examined relationships between these variables. The findings suggest that while generative AI holds promise for informal digital language learning by facilitating imagination of an ideal multilingual self, there are opportunities to enhance functionality for L2 contexts.

However, it still remains difficult for human experts to understand how such results are achieved, due to the “black box” nature of the deep models used. In high-stake decision making scenarios such as the interpretation of medical imaging for diagnostics, such a lack of transparency still hinders the adoption of these techniques in practice. In this position paper we present a conceptual methodology for the design of a neuro-symbolic cycle to address the need for explainability and confidence (including trust) of deep learning models when used to support human experts in high-stake decision making, and we discuss challenges and opportunities in the implementation of such cycle as well as its adoption in real world scenarios. We elaborate on the need to leverage the potential of hybrid artificial intelligence combining neural learning and symbolic reasoning in a human-centered approach to explainability. We advocate that the phases of such a cycle should include i) the extraction of knowledge from a trained network to represent and encode its behaviour, ii) the validation of the extracted knowledge through commonsense and domain knowledge, iii) the generation of explanations for human experts, iv) the ability to map human feedback into the validated representation from i), and v) the injection of some of this knowledge in a non-trained network to enable knowledge-informed representation learning. The holistic combination of causality, expressive logical inference, and representation learning, would result in a seamless integration of (neural) learning and (cognitive) reasoning that makes it possible to retain access to the inherently explainable symbolic representation without losing the power of the deep representation. The involvement of human experts in the design, validation and knowledge injection process is crucial, as the conceptual approach paves the way for a new human–ai paradigm where the human role goes beyond that of labeling data, towards the validation of neural-cognitive knowledge and processes.</jats:p>"

However, most existing human-computer collaborative programming learning is supported by traditional computers with a relatively low level of personalized interaction, which greatly limits the efficiency of students’ efficiency of programming learning and development of computational thinking. To address the above issues, this study introduces generative AI into human-computer collaborative programming learning and proposes a dialogue-negotiated human-computer collaborative programming learning method based on generative AI. The method focuses on the problems-solving process and constructs multiple agents through Prompt design, which enable students to improve their computational thinking and master programming skills in the process of human-computer interaction for problem-solving. Finally, a quasi-experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in a 10th grade computer programming course in a high school. 43 students in the experimental group learned with the proposed method, while 42 students in the control group adopted the traditional computer-supported human-computer collaborative programming learning method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method more significantly improved students’ computational thinking, programming learning attitudes, and learning achievement.

However, existing methods still face major challenges in style controllability, emotion consistency, and user satisfaction prediction. This study proposes a multimodal AI art generation strategy based on Stable Diffusion and BERT, using ControlNet, text-to-image (T2I)-Adapter, style–emotion mapping (SEM), sentiment prediction optimization, guided score distillation (GSD), and score-based generative model (SGM) to achieve high-quality, personalized art generation. First, ControlNet and T2I-Adapter are introduced into the Stable Diffusion method to enhance the fine control of text descriptions, visual references, and style labels, and improve the controllability and emotion consistency of generated content. In addition, a SEM model is constructed to establish a deep correspondence between user emotions and visual aesthetics using multimodal feature learning (including color, composition, and style attributes). Afterwards, GSD and SGM are used to optimize the diffusion model to minimize the interference of irrelevant information and ensure high-quality, emotion-consistent art output. The test results show that this method has significant advantages in style controllability, user emotion consistency, and satisfaction prediction accuracy, and provides new ideas for personalized art design, emotion-driven content generation, and optimization of human–computer interaction experience.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we explore the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT to address core problems of the ASWB exams, including the use of a multiple-choice format that does not reflect real-world social work practice. To assess its social work reasoning, we used ChatGPT to answer ASWB-developed practice questions for the Bachelors, Masters, and Clinical exams. ChatGPT scored 76%, 80%, and 64%, respectively, and identified additional validity challenges. Based on this performance, we provide a proof-of-concept for how generative AI might move us toward a more valid and equitable exam. While we strongly support licensure requirements, state regulators and legislators should temporarily suspend the use of the ASWB exams for this purpose. </jats:p>"

GenAI tools include chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) and may be particularly attractive to patients and caregivers for their wide accessibility and potential to improve access to information. However, since these tools’ quality parameters (i.e., accuracy) have been shown to be problematic, a deeper understanding of what contributes to patients’ and caregivers’ trust of GenAI tools is needed. Thus, we conducted a review of empirical literature to identify correlates of trust in GenAI tools among patients and caregivers. Based on 24 studies, there is emerging evidence that there is a moderate level of trust of GenAI among patients. No studies examined caregivers. We inductively identified five groupings of factors that contribute to patients’ trust of GenAI. These were individuals (e.g., health literacy, trait trust), tasks (e.g., administrative vs. diagnosis), agent design (e.g., personalization), agent implementation (e.g., government oversight), and agent performance (e.g., reliability). This review suggests that multi-level factors influence patients’ trust in GenAI agents. Additional research is needed on caregivers, publicly accessible GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), and developing and validating trust in GenAI instruments.</jats:p>"

The paper begins with analysing various KG completion algorithms considering only factual information such as transductive and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms.

            The widespread integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our daily lives has spurred an escalating demand for explainable AI (XAI). This demand is particularly pronounced in critical domains such as healthcare and finance, where understanding the decision-making processes of AI models is paramount. Despite noteworthy strides in XAI, prevailing approaches often neglect the crucial dimension of context, resulting in explanations that are challenging to comprehend and act upon for different stakeholders. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift towards context-sensitive explainability, tailoring explanations to users’ specific needs and understanding promoting inclusivity and accessibility. We propose a novel context taxonomy and a versatile framework, “ConEX” for developing context-sensitive explanations using any state-of-the-art post hoc explainer. Our empirical user study highlights diverse preferences for contextualization levels, emphasizing the importance of catering to these preferences to build trust and satisfaction in AI systems. Our contributions extend beyond the theoretical realm, offering practical guidance for developing context-sensitive explanations that are tailored to the specific needs of diverse stakeholders. By embracing context-sensitive explainability, we can unlock the true potential of AI, fostering trust, transparency, and informed decision-making across various domains.

However, in domains where data is scarce or sensitive, ML models often exhibit sub-optimal performance. Our hypothesis is that semantically enriching the available training dataset can enhance the predictive power of ML models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose novel neuro-symbolic approaches that augment tabular data with knowledge graph (KG) information, providing additional context and structure to improve model performance. Concretely, we introduce and examine several integration techniques of KG information through embeddings and explore how different KG embedding algorithms affect model performance, with a specific focus on accuracy and F2 scores. Our evaluation involves four distinct ML algorithms and four KG embedding techniques. We apply our approach to binary classification tasks on tabular data, including heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Our experimental results show improvements in performance particularly when tabular data is augmented with distance features computed in the embedding space. Notably, we achieve gains in F2 scores, such as an increase in XGBoost performance from 75.19% to 90.85% for heart disease prediction.

In this paper, we argue that requirements definition and satisfaction can go a long way to make machine learning models even more fitting to the real world, especially in critical domains. To this end, we present two problems in which (i) requirements arise naturally, (ii) machine learning models are or can be fruitfully deployed, and (iii) neglecting the requirements can have dramatic consequences. Our proposed pyramid development process integrates requirements specification into every stage of the machine learning pipeline, ensuring mutual influence between requirements and subsequent phases. Additionally, we explore the pivotal role of Neuro-symbolic AI in facilitating this integration, paving the way for more reliable and robust machine learning applications in critical domains.

Firstly, a dual behavior learning module is designed, where the role-based behavior learning submodule constructs graphlet degree vector by identifying four self-isomorphic orbits to capture deep structural features, while the attribute-based behavior learning submodule obtains attribute vectors through graph convolutional network. Then, the results are combined in the dynamic edge representation module to form the dynamic representations of edges to capture dual behavior patterns. Lastly, the anomaly detection module is designed to detect newly generated edges by combining contrastive learning with gated recurrent unit.

As a crucial task in video understanding, action recognition has significant applications in live broadcasting, autonomous driving, and medical diagnostics. The attention mechanisms in transformers mimicking human visual attention allocation, thereby enhancing the processing capabilities and comprehension of long video sequences. However, they often overlook the aggregation of multiscale detail features and the hierarchical representations of early visual information. Additionally, attention networks are computationally intensive and parameter-heavy, complicating model training and extending inference times, rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications. To crack these nuts, we propose a lightweight multiscale action recognition model based on convolutional enhancement block (ConvEB) and multiscale average pooling encoder. The ConvEB aims to establish long-range dependencies among multiscale local features in the early stages of the network, providing effective inductive biases for the attention network to compensate for the loss of detailed information. Moreover, we introduce a parallel pooling mixer to replace the original attention mixer, ensuring model lightweight while maintaining recognition accuracy. Finally, we deploy this model in the construction of a virtual panorama live broadcasting system.

            The predicates used for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems are usually elusive and need to be hand-crafted in advance, which limits the generalization of the system when learning new rules without sufficient background knowledge. Predicate Invention (PI) for ILP is the problem of discovering new concepts that describe hidden relationships in the domain. PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic rules. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for Neuro-Symbolic-ILP (NeSy-ILP) systems that can handle 3D visual inputs to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is still unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach, NeSy-

A feed-forward multilayer neural network has been applied to a case study of pine forests of Castilla La Mancha (Central–Eastern Spain), where seed germination and seedling survival, with or without seed protection, of four pine species ( Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Pinus halepensis, and Pinus sylvestris) were observed throughout 10 years under three soil conditions (scalped, wildfire-affected, and unaltered soils). The results we obtained have witnessed the good capacity of ANNs to predict both stages of pine initial recruitment.

            In this article, we present an approach to enrich transformers with additional information for general classification tasks given a set of relevant helper labels. We investigate whether the addition of preselected emotions as relevant helper labels can improve sentiment classification using BERT and DistilBERT. This method generates zero-shot labels like emotions for sentiment, and uses them as auxiliary text and classifier inputs to contribute to the final sentiment prediction. The approach has shown improvements in F1 score primarily for small datasets (1,000–50,000 samples). We also found that large, difficult-to-improve datasets such as the Sentiment140 dataset, with 1.6 million samples, also benefited from our approach. We tested the improvements on a smaller dataset, specifically an airline dataset comprising over 11,500 samples, and on subsamples of the Sentiment140 dataset with sizes ranging from 500 to 50,000. We conducted an ablation study on the zero-shot labels, which indicated that more labels generally improve the model. Our results show improvements in all cases over the original model for both BERT and DistilBERT when tested with added emotion inputs generated from zero-shot pretrained models.

We implemented a scoring system to enhance the performance of a few-shot training. This involves constructing finely tuned prompts composed of dialog samples with the highest scores. The scoring process is grounded in a set of heuristics that specifically assess the structure and content of the dialogs. The use of the scoring system resulted in enhanced ROUGE scores and positive evaluations from human assessors.

In turn, classical description logics reasoners cannot be applied as no useful inference results can be generated in the face of inconsistencies. Meanwhile, classical reasoners can be used in order to retrieve the inconsistency explanations, but as the KG size grows larger the required time for this task increases significantly.

In terms of determining sensitive attributes, existing studies tend to rely too heavily on sociological knowledge and neglect the importance of exploring potential sensitive attributes directly from the data itself. The accuracy of this approach is limited when dealing with data that cannot be fully explained by sociological factors. Regarding data bias correction, existing methods are primarily categorized into causality-based and association-based methods. The former requires a deep understanding of the underlying causal structure in the dataset, which is often difficult to achieve in practice. The latter method correlates sensitive attributes with algorithmic results through statistical measures, but this approach often tends to ignore the impact of sensitive attributes on other attributes. In this paper, we formalize the identification of sensitive attributes as a problem solvable through data analysis, without relying on commonly recognized knowledge in social science. We also propose a data pre-processing method that considers the effects of attributes correlated with sensitive attributes to enhance algorithmic fairness by combining the association-based bias reduction method. We evaluated our proposed method on a public dataset. The evaluation results indicate that our method can accurately identify sensitive attributes and improve the fairness of machine learning algorithms compared to existing methods.</jats:p>"

In the diffusion model architecture, this paper adds the nonlinear learnable activation function Kolmogorov–Arnold network to the noise estimation network U-Net to generate higher quality enhanced images.

            This paper presents exact local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (ELIME) algorithm for explainable machine learning, which provides a comprehensible explanation of the decision-making process and predictions of machine learning models. Building upon existing model-agnostic interpretation methods, our approach enhances feature importance evaluation through single-feature sensitivity analysis and introduces a weighted distance metric based on sensitivity values. This sensitivity information is utilized for both calculating distances and generating training data for model fitting, improving the quality and reliability of the explanations. The enhanced ELIME algorithm is particularly effective for tabular classification domains, offering explanations that closely resemble the decision boundaries of the model. Comparative analysis with local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME), deterministic LIME (DLIME), and active learning-based DLIME (AL-DLIME) demonstrates that while ELIME achieves superior fidelity and accuracy compared to DLIME and AL-DLIME, its stability is lower. However, ELIME outperforms LIME across all three metrics.

            Knowledge graphs (KGs) feature ever more frequently as symbolic components in neurosymbolic research and systems. But even though a central concern of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is to combine neural learning with symbolic reasoning, relatively little neurosymbolic research focuses on leveraging the logical representation and reasoning capabilities of Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based KGs. The objective of this position article is to inspire more neurosymbolic researchers to embrace the OWL and the Semantic Web by raising awareness of the benefits, capabilities, and applications of OWL-based KGs, particularly with respect to logical reasoning. We describe the ecosystem of open W3C standards-based resources available that support the adoption and use of OWL-based KGs; we describe tools that exist for engineering custom OWL ontologies tailored to particular research needs; we discuss the encoding of background KG knowledge in subsymbolic embedding spaces and various applications of this approach; we discuss and illustrate the reasoning capabilities of OWL-based KGs; and we describe several promising directions for research that focus on leveraging these reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the specialised resources needed to undertake research on OWL-based KGs in neurosymbolic systems. We use the example of NeSy4VRD, an image dataset with a custom-designed companion OWL ontology. The scarcity of this kind of resource should be addressed to accelerate research in this field.

Our research aims to enhance theater accessibility using computer vision techniques to detect visual information about objects and actor gestures and convey them to blind audiences through non-visual modalities. In this work, we focus on providing a novel dataset, TS-RGBD, containing theater scenes to guide the development of computer-vision-based systems for theater scene description. It includes RGB, depth, and skeleton sequences captured by Microsoft Kinect in a theatrical setting. The dataset features untrimmed theater scenes as well as trimmed sequences consisting of individual gestures for actor gesture recognition. We test state-of-the-art image captioning models on untrimmed scenes, revealing that dense captioning models generate redundant captions with fixed numbers, leading to imprecise descriptions and a lack of context. These challenges hinder visually impaired individuals from comprehending theater scenes descriptions effectively. Additionally, we assess the performance of skeleton-based graph convolution networks for human action recognition in a theater environment using trimmed skeleton sequences. The results highlight limitations in recognizing human actions in this setting. Based on these findings, we propose solutions for overcoming these challenges, paving the way for future improvements in making theater performances more accessible to individuals with visual impairments.</jats:p>"

It explores how scene graph generation, a process that detects and analyses objects, visual relationships and attributes in scenes, serves as a symbolic scene representation. This representation forms the basis for higher-level visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, image retrieval, image generation, and multimodal event processing. Infusing common sense knowledge, particularly through the use of heterogeneous knowledge graphs, improves the accuracy, expressiveness and reasoning ability of the representation and allows for intuitive downstream reasoning.

However, the usage of AI is prone to bias and misinformation and can be used to manipulate. Therefore, various lawmakers such as the European Union aim to enforce AI disclosure messages to protect consumers. But the implications of such disclosures have not yet been studied. This paper draws on existing theories in persuasion knowledge, disclosure theory, inferences of manipulative intent, and AI aversion to develop a model to understand consumer attitudes toward AI disclosures in Instagram advertisements. A three-condition between-subjects online experiment ( N<jats:sub>final</jats:sub>  = 161) was conducted to test the model. The data were analyzed using a moderated mediation model. AI disclosures lead to a direct decrease in advertising attitude. In addition, AI disclosures lead to a decrease in brand attitude only when consumers have high AI aversion. There were no effects of AI disclosures on source credibility. These effects were mediated by inferences of manipulative intent. However, participants who viewed the AI disclosure had lower inferences of manipulative intent and then participants who did not view the AI disclosure. Furthermore, no differences were found between AI disclosures pertaining to the use of AI in the creation of the image or the text. Implications are discussed from both theoretical and managerial viewpoints and highlight why the use of AI on social media for advertising purposes should be limited as it will become more transparent in the future. </jats:p>"

However, these performance improvements often come at a high computational cost, which limits their practical application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dual-branch SR model (DBSR) that enhances both model performance and efficiency through primary and auxiliary branches. The primary branch integrates the advantages of channel recalibration, a separable swin transformer (SST), and a spatial refinement module to achieve fine-grained feature extraction. The SST serves as the core of the primary branch, employing hierarchical window attention calculations to facilitate lightweight and effective multiscale feature representation. Conversely, the auxiliary branch enhances shallow features through a global information enhancement module, which mitigates the misleading effects of directly upsampling these shallow features on the SR results. Comparative and ablation experiments conducted on four RSI datasets and five SR benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DBSR method effectively balances the number of parameters with performance, showcasing its potential for application in RSI processing. </jats:p>"

We consider a variant of the p-median problem where distance constraints exist between facilities and between facilities and demand points. This problem can be used to model the requirements that arise when locating semi-obnoxious facilities. We first introduce integer linear programming and constraint programming (CP) models and implement them in Gurobi and OR-Tools, respectively. Then, we describe a greedy heuristic that can be used to prune branches during a search within an incomplete CP solver. We also introduce a number of domain-specific value ordering heuristics that can be applied within such a solver. The developed method is evaluated under different problem generation models, and compared to Gurobi and OR-Tools.

            In recent years, vision-language pretraining (VLP) models have become a crucial driving force in the advancement of artificial intelligence. Besides, studies such as contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated that incorporating prompt learning within VLP models can significantly enhance the performance of downstream tasks. However, we believe that CLIP’s visual encoder suffers from feature extraction bias in image classification tasks, which is because of the uneven quantity and distribution of image features CLIP learned between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. This can be further summarized as an inherent bias in feature extraction for differently distributed samples during the pretraining phase. To address the above problem this paper proposes (i) text-semantic hierarchical injection prompt learning method, which constructs self-attention layers and prompt mapping structures and injects text semantic features into the visual encoder layer by layer to generate visual prompt features and (ii) visual-semantic attention interactive prompt learning method, which further integrates text embeddings with the output features of the visual encoder through cross-attention and constructs instance-level text prompt features for each image. Based on the two above methods, this paper further proposes the multimodal coupling prompt learning CLIP (MCPL-CLIP) to enhance CLIP’s performance in image classification tasks. Experiments conducted on 15 image classification datasets demonstrate that MCPL-CLIP outperforms baseline models such as MaPLe, CoCoOp, and CoOp in cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, and base-to-novel class generalization tasks, showcasing its superior text semantic representation and visual feature extraction capabilities.

One major challenge however is to disentangle, or factorize, the distributed representation of data structures into their constituent elements without having to search through all possible combinations. This factorization becomes more challenging when SBCs vectors are noisy due to perceptual uncertainty and approximations made by modern neural networks to generate the query SBCs vectors. To address these challenges, we first propose a fast and highly accurate method for factorizing a more flexible and hence generalized form of SBCs, dubbed GSBCs.

Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research. We hope this analysis sheds more light on the dynamics of the CI ecosystem. </jats:p>"

Various factors, including human error and machine failure, contribute to the emergence of missing values in datasets. Datasets containing missing values not only consume storage space but also pose a significant obstacle to direct utilization, resulting in substantial resource wastage. Consequently, accurately imputing missing values has emerged as a focal point in research. Generative missing value imputation methods, leveraging generative models, have demonstrated notable efficacy in recent years by directly generating values for missing components based on observable data values. This paper introduces a novel generative method for missing value imputation based on a diffusion denoising model, termed the conditional diffusion model for missing value imputation (CDMVI). Specifically, CDMVI trains a conditional diffusion model using complete data samples (samples devoid of missing values) and subsequently utilizes the trained model to impute missing values in datasets. During the training stage (i.e., the forward process of the diffusion model), a subset of features is randomly selected from complete data samples, and varying levels of random noise are introduced as condition inputs to the noise predictor within the diffusion model. In the imputation stage (i.e., the backward process of the diffusion model), the missing segments of the data are initially replaced with random noise, serving as a guide for the diffusion model to generate complete samples. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed CDMVI method. </jats:p>"

            The degradation of images captured in hazy weather can severely affect practical applications. However, most existing learning-based methods ignore the varied haze distribution in an image, resulting in incomplete dehazing of some areas. Also, the presence of haze can blur the textures and details, which will heavily impact the subsequent image processing. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based framework for dehazing tasks called HITFormer. Firstly, we introduce a texture recovery and enhance module as a preprocess to strengthen details. Then, we propose an adaptive haze intensity prediction subnet to predict the haze intensity of different areas. Lastly, we use a semantic-based luminance and chrominance adjustment module to fuse the feature maps in YUV color space and form a transformation coefficient to get a recovery image. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our HITFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on several image dehazing datasets.

            Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify objects seamlessly embedded in the surrounding environment. Due to the high inherent similarity between the texture of the camouflaged object and its complex background, making COD far more challenging than traditional target detection. To solve these problems, we propose a method that uses holistic boundary information to optimize COD through a two-stage strategy. Specifically, the feature enhancement module is initially implemented to refine features at different scales and emphasize boundary details of camouflaged entities. Then, our network employs a boundary localization module to guide low-level local edge features through high-level global semantic. Furthermore, the boundary-embedded feature aggregation module is introduced to achieve cross-level fusion of multi-scale features, by embedding and effectively activating boundary information, which reduces the interference from cluttered backgrounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the other 17 state-of-the-art COD methods. The source code and results of our method are available at

            Image compression is crucial for reducing storage and transmission costs, particularly in applications involving high-resolution and complex imagery. Traditional compression methods, such as JPEG, PNG, and newer lossless formats like JPEG XL and WebP, often suffer from suboptimal compression ratios (CRs) and image quality when handling modern high-definition content. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based lossless image compression method. The symmetrical transformer (STF) model is introduced, integrating transformer blocks in both the downsampling encoder and upsampling decoder to enhance the capture of local and global features. The model also includes a multivariate mixture distribution channel conditioning (MMCC) entropy model, which improves pixel dependency predictions by modeling complex relationships within image channels. Additionally, an automated searching of optimal kernel shapes (SOKS) is employed to dynamically configure kernel sizes, optimizing the convolutional layers for different image regions. The system also applies stripe-wise pruning (SWP), which selectively prunes unimportant features during compression, reducing computational complexity and memory usage without compromising image quality. Extensive evaluations on standard datasets, including Kodak, CLIC, and DIV2K, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Specifically, the approach achieves significant compression efficiency, with bits-per-dimension (BPD) values of 3.06 on Kodak, 3.91 on CLIC, and 3.63 on DIV2K, outperforming traditional methods such as iVPF (3.20 BPD on Kodak), GOLLIC (3.15 BPD on Kodak), and MSPSM (3.12 BPD on Kodak). In addition to compression efficiency, the proposed method excels in inference speed, with encoding times as low as 7.80 ms per sample on Kodak, significantly faster than competing methods. These results demonstrate a substantial improvement in compression rates and image reconstruction quality, highlighting the model's potential for real-world applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and real-time streaming, offering a significant advancement in lossless image compression.

            In recent years, pervasive use of sensors in smart devices, e.g., phones, watches, medical devices, has increased dramatically the availability of personal data. However, existing research on data collection primarily focuses on the objective view of reality, as provided, for instance, by sensors, often neglecting the integration of subjective human input, as provided, for instance, by user answers to questionnaires. This limits substantially the exploitability of the collected data. In this paper, we present a methodology and a platform designed for the collection of a combination of large-scale sensor data and qualitative human feedback. The methodology has been designed to be deployed on top, and enrich functionalities of an existing data collection APP, called iLog, which has been used in large scale, worldwide data collection experiments. The main goal is to put the key actors involved in an experiment, i.e., the researcher in charge, the participant, and iLog in better control of the experiment itself, thus improving the quality and richness of the data collected. The novel functionalities of the resulting platform are: (i) a time-wise representation of the situational context within which the data collection is performed, (ii) an explicit representation of the temporal context within which the data collection is performed, (iii) a calendar-based dashboard for the real-time monitoring of the data collection context(s), and, (iv) a mechanism for the run-time revision of the data collection plan. The practicality and utility of the proposed functionalities are demonstrated in a case study involving 350 University students.

In this paper, we propose a novel method called irrelevant visual information suppression, which aims to alleviate the interference of irrelevant visual information in images on manipulation detection feature extraction, thereby obtaining generic manipulation traces that are more subtle and unrelated to semantic visual information. In general, most manipulation operations leave traces at manipulation edges. Therefore, we introduce a specially designed manipulated edge information enhancement branch aimed at identifying these edge artifacts more accurately. We construct a dual-branch network, where each branch uses ResNet-50 as the backbone to capture as many multi-scale manipulation features as possible. Finally, we adopt a multi-view feature learning method that combines the manipulated edge information enhancement branch with the irrelevant visual information suppression branch and is trained with multi-scale (pixel/edge/image/irrelevant visual information suppression) supervision. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments using five image manipulation localization datasets, including CASIAv1, CASIAv2, COVER, Columbia, and NIST16. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in terms of F1 score.

In this study, we investigate how ethical principles (explainability, fairness, security, accountability, accuracy, privacy, and machine autonomy) are weighted in comparison to each other. This is especially important, since simultaneously considering ethical principles is not only costly, but sometimes even impossible, as developers must make specific trade-off decisions. In this paper, we give first answers on the relative importance of ethical principles given a specific use case—the use of artificial intelligence in tax fraud detection. The results of a large conjoint survey ([Formula: see text]) suggest that, by and large, German respondents evaluate the ethical principles as equally important. However, subsequent cluster analysis shows that different preference models for ethically designed systems exist among the German population. These clusters substantially differ not only in the preferred ethical principles but also in the importance levels of the principles themselves.

To solve this problem, we propose a highly efficient pillar-based model named MASNet, which mainly consists of a pillar mix attention (PMA) module, an attention-pooling operation, and a focal sparse network (FSN) module. The PMA module encodes the pillar features by fusion of the point-wise attention module and the channel-wise attention module. The attention-pooling operation aggregates the attention-encoded pillar features in a more comprehensive way to obtain the most expressive pillar features. In addition, the FSN module exploits the intrinsic sparsity of the data by introducing focal sparse convolution, which enriches the learned pillar features in the foreground without adding redundant pillars in other regions. On the KITTI three-dimensional (3D) Object Detection Benchmark, it achieves a 3D average precision of (77.81%, 60.30%, and 53.92%) in easy, moderate, and hard levels, which outperforms other pillar-based methods for the detection of cyclists.

The research community has examined a range of approaches to address this issue. However, most of these approaches are for a comparatively limited set of languages, especially English. Research on semantic word similarity for South Asian languages, particularly Urdu, is immature. In recent years, transformer-based approaches have proved extremely successful for a range of language processing tasks. The primary aim of this study is to develop and compare a variety of transformer-based approaches to the cross-lingual English–Urdu semantic word similarity task. This study evaluated a publicly available benchmark USWS-19 corpus that comprises 518 word pairs. This study mainly explored four types of transformer-based approaches: (a) cross-lingual sentence transformer-based approaches using the original dataset, (b) cross-lingual sentence transformer-based approaches using the translated dataset (translation plus monolingual analysis [T+MA] approach), (c) the feature fusion approach (mixture of features), and large language models. In addition, this study also explores the word embedding-based approach using the translated dataset (T+MA approach). In total, this study developed 29 transformer-based models, with the highest results (Pearson correlation = 0.788) achieved using a feature fusion approach, that is, Best-Two-SBERT (where SBERT stands for sentence-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers; using T+MA) + BEST Baseline (with Bing translator) + Best cross-lingual SBERT.

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a text-to-image generation method (cascaded structure and joint attention generative adversarial network (CSGAN)) that combines cascaded structure and joint attention. After encoding the text, this method utilizes a conditional enhancement module to process it, which enhances the expressive ability of the text features. In order to make the local area of the image better fit the text features, this method designs a joint attention module to solve the problem that the image generation process cannot fully reflect the local details of the text content. By using affine transform mapping visual features and cascade structure to fuse the features of different modules, the integrity of the whole content of the image is effectively guaranteed and the semantic consistency of the text image is improved. Experimental results on the CUB dataset show that compared with the current mainstream non-stacked network model DF-GAN model, the inception score index of the CSGAN model is improved by about 4.01%, and the Fréchet inception distance index is reduced by about 13.36%. These data indicators and visualization results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSGAN model.</jats:p>"

            With the advancement of technology, the demand for healthy eating has increased, making food classification a research hotspot. Existing deep learning-based food image classification models demonstrate high accuracy but require substantial computational resources, limiting their use on resource-constrained devices. In this study, a lightweight convolutional neural network model named MSNet for food classification is proposed. MSNet mainly consists of M Blocks and S Blocks. The M Block uses improved depthwise convolution to reduce the computational cost of conventional convolutions, and the S Block uses channel shuffle techniques to enhance feature information flow between channels without increasing additional computation, effectively capturing relationships between different channel features. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (ETHZ Food-101, Vireo Food-172, and ISIA Food-500) show that MSNet achieves top-1 accuracies of 86.24%, 87.98%, and 65.70%, with model sizes of 13.8 MB, 15.9 MB, and 25.4 MB, respectively, outperforming mainstream models in terms of computational efficiency. Further quantization produces two MSNet-Lite variants with competitive model size, while maintaining high accuracy and significantly improving inference speed. Additionally, visualization analysis indicates that MSNet effectively extracts essential features of food images, offering good interpretability and generalization across datasets of varying complexity. The proposed MSNet model provides a feasible solution for practical deployment in food classification tasks on mobile and embedded devices.

However, the heterogeneity of multimodal signals poses a challenge in learning modality representation and fusing information. To address it, the BiMSA (multimodal sentiment analysis based on BiGRU and bidirectional interactive attention) is proposed in this paper. In the modality representation learning layer, BiMSA incorporates a structure consisting of BiGRU to extract contextual information from video and audio inputs. Subsequently, modality features are projected into modality internal representations and interactive representations for extracting information. This practice allows the model to take into account more aspects of modality information. In terms of the modality fusion layer, a bidirectional interactive attention mechanism is used to focus on the key representations of key modalities, and integrate multimodal information flexibly and efficiently. Attention weights are concentrated on modality representations that synergistically contribute toward overall sentiment orientation. Additionally, the constraints of similarity loss and difference loss are introduced to align with representations while mitigating redundant information and achieving a better fusion effect. Experimental results on public datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI) demonstrate the effectiveness of the BiMSA model.</jats:p>"

SAM-YOLO incorporates the simple attention mechanism into the YOLOv7 network, allowing for the capture of more detailed information without introducing additional parameters. In this study, we experimentally redesigned the backbone network of SAM-YOLO by replacing the redundant part of the network layer with the C3 module, resulting in improved model performance while maintaining accuracy. The experimental results show that the SAM-YOLO algorithm performs excellently in several evaluation metrics under conventional conditions, especially outperforming other algorithms in accuracy and mean average precision values. In tests on the ExLight dataset facing extreme lighting conditions, SAM-YOLO similarly demonstrated optimal detection capabilities, especially in terms of robustness when dealing with complex lighting variations.

            Recent advances in deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques for remote sensing images (RSIs) have shown significant promise. However, these performance improvements often come at a high computational cost, which limits their practical application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dual-branch SR model (DBSR) that enhances both model performance and efficiency through primary and auxiliary branches. The primary branch integrates the advantages of channel recalibration, a separable swin transformer (SST), and a spatial refinement module to achieve fine-grained feature extraction. The SST serves as the core of the primary branch, employing hierarchical window attention calculations to facilitate lightweight and effective multiscale feature representation. Conversely, the auxiliary branch enhances shallow features through a global information enhancement module, which mitigates the misleading effects of directly upsampling these shallow features on the SR results. Comparative and ablation experiments conducted on four RSI datasets and five SR benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DBSR method effectively balances the number of parameters with performance, showcasing its potential for application in RSI processing.

However, this domain continues to confront numerous challenges, especially due to the lack of precise temporal annotations. Consequently, this technique becomes highly susceptible to contextual background noise and overly reliant on prominent action segments, leading to less-than-ideal action localization. To alleviate this problem, we propose the contrastive learning-based action salience network (CLASNet), comprising two pivotal modules: feature contrast separation module (FCSM) and boundary refinement module (BRM). FCSM utilizes a contrastive learning approach to effectively separate action features from background features, thereby enhancing the discriminability of features. Concurrently, BRM introduces boundary refinement loss to rectify the temporal boundaries of actions, thereby further elevating the precision of temporal localization. The collaborative functioning of these two key modules effectively resolves the ambiguity issues in temporal action localization under weak supervision, markedly enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, CLASNet is versatile and can be integrated into different WTAL frameworks, achieving enhanced localization performance while preserving the original end-to-end training manner. Utilizing three large-scale benchmark action localization datasets, THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.2, and ActivityNet v1.3, we embed CLASNet into various cutting-edge weakly supervised temporal action localization methods, such as CO2-Net, DELU, and ACRNet, for empirical substantiation. The experimental outcomes reveal that CLASNet significantly enhances the efficacy of these methods in action localization, offering novel perspectives for the advancement of temporal action localization technology. </jats:p>"

            Triangle meshes are a crucial and powerful data type for three-dimensional (3D) shapes, extensively studied in the fields of computer vision and computer graphics. In this paper, we delve into the challenge of analyzing deforming 3D triangle meshes using deep neural networks. While existing methods extend graph-based deep learning to 3D triangle meshes using graph convolution, the lack of effective graph convolutional structures and pooling operations limits the learning capacity of their networks. We propose a variational autoencoder structure that integrates graph convolutional residual blocks with multilayer pooling to explore the latent space of 3D shapes for generation. This framework introduces graph convolutional residual blocks to address the issue of gradient vanishing in deep networks. By employing multilayer pooling and unpooling structures based on triangle mesh simplification, gradually reducing the spatial dimensions of the input, the model can extract more general features. This enables it to handle denser mesh models effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our generalized framework can learn reasonable representations of deformable shape collections with minimal training examples. It produces competitive results across various applications, including shape generation and interpolation, requiring fewer training samples and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

            Although neural-symbolic techniques for symbol grounding in sensory data have shown significant effectiveness, they still require substantial training. This article revisits symbolic-only approaches by introducing a new algorithm for creating hierarchical concept structures from spatial sensory data. The method is based on Bateson’s idea of difference as the fundamental element of concept formation. By leveraging this principle, the algorithm extracts atomic features from raw data through basic sequential comparisons within a stream of multivariate numerical values. Experiments carried out on a set of common objects indicate that the method can successfully discriminate and assimilate categories as needed without training. The results show that the model improves on the neural networks it has been tested against, which required more than 400 training examples for the same task. The results also show that the model can generate rich conceptual structures and human-like representations, which (i) facilitate high composability, (ii) support formal reasoning, (iii) inherently enable generalisation, and (iv) possess potential for generative behaviour. Consequently, this approach offers a compelling contribution to symbol grounding and neural-symbolic research by providing a seamless algorithm to bridge perception and conceptual knowledge.

sage,Federated Learning Strategies for Integrating Composite Meta-Consistency Loss With Multi-Head Attention,10.1177/30504554251340238,,Afei Li; Xiaolei Yang; Li Ma; Lu Yu; Liyu Hao; Yongshan Liu,The European Journal on Artificial Intelligence,2025,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/30504554251340238,"<jats:p>In order to solve the problem of accuracy decline caused by feature redundancy, this paper designs a federated learning strategy that combines composite meta-consistency loss and multi-head attention. Firstly, this paper decorrelates the features based on the dual theory of constraints to eliminate redundant information, and improves the stability of the model through gradient-based regularization. Composite meta-consistency loss is constructed based on these two optimization methods. Experiments show that compared with the latest algorithms, the maximum accuracy of CIFAR-10 and Oxford-Pets in this paper is improved by 0.82% and 2.19%, respectively. After that, this paper introduces multi-head attention into the framework of federated learning. After capturing richer context information in the process of feature extraction, the combination of inner-layer update and outer-layer update of the meta-learning method enables the federated learning framework to effectively cope with the data distribution of different clients and finally accelerate the convergence speed. Compared with other algorithms, the average accuracy of the first 40 rounds in the MINIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets is higher. In CIFAR-10, SVHN, Oxford-Pets, taking Robust-HDP as the benchmark, the speedup ratio reaches 1.5, 1.42, and 1.34, respectively, which is faster than other algorithms.</jats:p>"
sage,Integrating Temporality and Causality into Acyclic Argumentation Frameworks Using a Transition System,10.1177/30504554251319451,,Yann Munro; Camilo Sarmiento; Isabelle Bloch; Gauvain Bourgne; Catherine Pelachaud; Marie-Jeanne Lesot,The European Journal on Artificial Intelligence,2025,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/30504554251319451,"<jats:p>
            
            
            In the context of abstract argumentation, we present the benefits of considering temporality, i.e. the order in which arguments are enunciated, as well as causality. We propose a formal method to rewrite the concepts of acyclic abstract argumentation frameworks into an action language that allows us to model the evolution of the world and to establish causal relationships between the enunciation of arguments and their consequences on the acceptability of other arguments, whether direct or indirect. An Answer Set Programming implementation is also described. Furthermore, we lay the ground for the generation of explanations using the causal relations as well as two graphical representations to support such explanations.

This article argues that one of the effective ways to delineate the concept of AI is to compare and contrast it with human intelligence. In doing so, the article broaches the unique capabilities of humans and AI in relation to one another (human and machine tacit knowledge), as well as two types of AI systems: one that goes beyond human intelligence and one that is necessarily and inherently tied to it. It finally highlights how humans and AI can augment their capabilities and intelligence through synergistic human–AI interactions (i.e., human-augmented AI and augmented human intelligence), resulting in hybrid intelligence, and concludes with a future-looking research agenda. </jats:p>"

In this work, we address a famous combinatorial optimization problem on graphs, the graph coloring problem (GCP), and propose novel ways that train and utilize deep node embeddings to facilitate the problem’s solving. Specifically, we propose to use Transformer to learn the correlation between nodes in graphs. The Transformer learns the node embeddings (feature vectors) such that nodes that might be in the same color in (near-)optimal solutions have close embeddings. To generate the labels, we use a typical GCP heuristic called Tabucol to solve each small training instance multiple times. In this way, the labels are generated more efficiently and robustly as compared to using an exact solver. We then apply the learned embeddings to guide several construction and searching algorithms for the GCP, including Tabucol. Empirical results show that all the algorithms could be improved by utilizing the learned node embeddings, and our methods generalize well to graphs on much larger scales than the training graphs.</jats:p>"

Now some more mature tools are gradually being implemented. This review summarizes the current status of educational applications and research on AI-assisted programming technology. Through thematic coding of literature, existing research focuses on five aspects: underlying technology and tool introduction, performance evaluation, the potential impacts and coping strategies, exploration of behavioral patterns in technological application, and ethical and safety issues. A systematic analysis of current literature provides the following insights for future academic research related to the practice of “human-machine pairing” in programming: (1) Affirming the value of AI code-generation tools while also clearly defining their technical limitations and ethical risks; (2) Developing adaptive teaching ecosystems and educational models, conducting comprehensive empirical research to explore the efficiency mechanisms of AI-human paired programming; (3) Further enriching the application of research methods by integrating speculative research with empirical research, combining traditional methods with emerging technologies.</jats:p>"

Additionally, a local feature aggregation module is utilized to learn the intensity features of small target point clouds through spatial intensity encoding. Furthermore, PointPillars technology is implemented to convert the three-dimensional point cloud into a pseudo-image, allowing for the extraction of features at various scales using a feature pyramid network. Experimental results demonstrate that MF-Net improves the mean average precision for pedestrian and cyclist detection by 2.49% and 2.88%, respectively, compared to the baseline network PointRCNN.

Nevertheless, as users may not recall all the details once finished, we propose an ethical conversational agent that respectfully conducts the survey during gameplay. To achieve this without hindering user’s engagement, we resort to reinforcement learning and an ethical embedding algorithm. Specifically, we transform the learning environment so that it guarantees that the agent learns to be respectful (i.e. aligned with the moral value of respect) while pursuing its individual objective of eliciting as much feedback information as possible. When applying this approach to a simple videogame, our comparative tests between the two agents (ethical and unethical) empirically demonstrate that endowing a survey-oriented conversational agent with this moral value of respect avoids disturbing user’s engagement while still pursuing its individual objective, which is to gather as much information as possible. </jats:p>"

            Paraphrasing involves rewording a text to maintain its meaning while using different language. In recent years, there has been growing interest among researchers in automatic paraphrase generation (APG). Previous studies have primarily focused on developing corpora and methods for APG tasks in English and other languages. However, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmark corpora and standardized methods specifically designed for APG in Urdu. To address this gap, this study introduces two extensive benchmark corpora: the Urdu Phrasal Paraphrase corpus (UPP-22 corpus) at the phrasal level and the Urdu Sentential Paraphrase corpus (USP-22 corpus) at the sentence level. The UPP-22 corpus contains 3,50,000 paraphrased pairs, while the USP-22 corpus consists of 11,000 paraphrased pairs, both specifically curated for the Urdu APG task. As a second major contribution, this research developed and applied various state-of-the-art deep learning models, including sequence-to-sequence models (using long short-term memory [LSTM], gated recurrent unit [GRU], bidirectional LSTM, and bidirectional GRU) and sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms as baseline methods for the proposed Urdu Paraphrase corpora. Additionally, the study introduced a bidirectional and auto-regressive transformer-based model specifically tailored to these corpora as a third contribution. A fourth significant contribution was the development of a test corpus at the phrasal level, consisting of 10,000 instances, created through automatic translation, followed by manual inspection and correction, to evaluate the performance of APG tasks for the Urdu language. As a fifth major contribution, the study applied and fine-tuned a large language model (GPT-4-Mini) for APG in Urdu, resulting in significant performance improvements. The evaluation was carried out using the standard bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) metric. The best results were achieved with BLEU-1 = 75.89 for the UPP-22 corpus and BLEU-1 = 75.16 for the USP-22 corpus using the GPT-4-Mini model, representing a significant improvement over all other models including baseline. These corpora and methodologies will be made publicly available to encourage and promote further research in APG for under-resourced languages such as Urdu.

We suggest allocation (ad placement) and pricing protocols which take into account preferences of both the publishers and the advertisers. The most promising protocol, the Weighted Bipartite Hungarian VCG protocol, collects the preferences of the auction’s participants and uses the Hungarian algorithm to maximize a weighted function of their preferences. Simulations show that this advantageous protocol can maintain a balanced budget over time while preserving most of the desired economic properties (e.g., individual rational, and truth telling), and reaches near optimal solutions. </jats:p>"

We consider a pool of service providers whose performance varies inversely with load. An agent's satisfaction with a service provider depends on a private function of the performance of the provider. An agent will ask for a referral from a centralized referral agency if its satisfaction from its current service provider is below its satisfaction threshold. Such an agent chooses one of the referred providers in the next time interval. The referral system reaches stability when all agents are satisfied with their current provider. We evaluate the relative merits of the following decisions by the centralized referral agency: number of service providers returned and the means for choosing those referrals. The performance metric used is the number of time periods to reach stable system configurations. Interesting observations include the advantage of performance proportionate and semi-deterministic schemes over deterministic referral decisions. </jats:p>

Tools have been implemented to support the re-configuration. Once new requirements are specified by business experts via the tools, the system automatically adapts its behaviour in the environment, without additional effort from developers. This novel approach pulls together a knowledgebase, configuration tools, and business experts as an integral environment through which the MAS achieves re-configurability ranging from overall infrastructure to individual policy sets. This fosters cost effective software evolution because much of the effort resulting from changes to business strategies and collaborations can be shifted from developers to customers, code change not being required since the environment maintains the dynamics instead. </jats:p>"

            scientific developments in the vehicle and infrastructure automation sectors are developing steadily to benefit end users in ways like reducing traffic congestion, enhancing safety, facilitating stress-free travel, reducing fuel costs, and enabling smart parking. Autonomous vehicles sometimes known as self-driving cars, can entirely replace conventional automobiles to accomplish safe and reliable intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Autonomous vehicles have improved sensing capabilities and can drive on roads that would be difficult for humans. Software, technology, and people, together with their interactions, are the building blocks of Autonomous vehicles. Even though Autonomous vehicles have been studied extensively, many issues have yet to be fixed. One of the biggest obstacles to developing Autonomous vehicles is improving their ability to communicate with other vehicles and pedestrians. Second, it's unclear whether society will benefit or suffer from people's tendency to place an excessive amount of faith in Autonomous vehicles and assume that they will never malfunction. Capabilities analysis is essential to making sure autonomous vehicles are safe and widely accepted. The proposed review outlines the key benefits, drawbacks, and difficulties of autonomous vehicle technology and provides a detailed analysis of the different autonomous vehicle mechanisms. Further, the developed review intends to formulate future prospects by examining the advantages and disadvantages of autonomous driving technology to encourage the development of innovative autonomous vehicle technologies to prevent human error and increase road safety and security.

            Vehicles (UAVs) made major advances in security and defence applications like information gathering, safety missions, monitoring, judicial systems, urban planning, disaster management, vehicle tracking, recreation, and farming assessment. Since they are controlled by intruders, hence the infiltrated UAVs performance is poor. Despite their numerous benefits, UAVs receive little attention in regards to security, exposing them to attack. The consequences of UAV hacking include the loss of top-secret details, and the loss of critical operations. The majority of intrusion risks are occurred due to the inadequate security in communication systems. Moreover, such communication presents security problems because of its dynamic topology. In this study, we analyse 50 research papers focusing on different secure communication systems in UAV strategies and their key problems. The research intention is carefully considered, because it is primarily concerned with the current problems via secure communication in UAVs. As a result, the analysis of numerous existing methods of secure communication in UAV, such as deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and so on is facilitated based on a number of measures, including the year of publication, performance metrics, outcome of the techniques in numerical evaluations, and other factors. In addition, the analysis of each method, and its merits and demerits are provided. The paper is concluded by discussing the possible future research instructions and difficulties realising in efficient secure communication in UAV.

            Crop production can be greatly affected by different diseases, which seriously threaten food security. Consequently, detecting plant diseases earlier and preventing the spread of plant diseases is necessary to avoid the economic imbalance. Nevertheless, the manual detection of plant diseases is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Numerous existing techniques are adopted that are unreliable in terms of accuracy and fail to identify the infected region due to non-uniform complex backgrounds resulting in mispredictions. Hence, this research presents a review that focuses on enhancing plant disease detection accuracy and early intervention. The comparison of various machine learning and deep learning techniques, data acquisition, segmentation methods, and feature extraction techniques are presented, particularly in disease prediction. The basic prediction approach encloses the classification model which is trained and the publicly available dataset or the collection of real-time data from the farms is tested. Those datasets include images of normal as well as plants with disease spots which serve as benchmarking datasets for the research. The paper recognizes challenges like limited data, scalability, and accuracy but seeks to leverage previous technologies to advance agricultural practices. Ultimately, the aim is to improve upon existing methodologies for more effective plant disease prediction, contributing to a more robust agricultural sector.

They have spurred massive investments in new tools for drafting texts, summarizing conversations, summarizing literature, generating images, coding simple programs, supporting education, and amusing humans. Experience with them has shown them likely to respond with fabrications (called ""hallucinations"") that severely undermine their trustworthiness and make them unsafe for critical applications. Here, we will examine the limitations of LLMs imposed by their design and function. These are not bugs but are inherent limitations of the technology. The same limitations make it unlikely that LLM machines will ever be capable of performing all human tasks at the skill levels of humans.</jats:p>"
