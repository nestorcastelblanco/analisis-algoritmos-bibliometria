The study was based on social cognition theory and a sample of 277 Israeli middle leaders from public elementary and secondary schools. The data were analysed using SPSS and the PROCESS macro. The findings indicate that support for GenAI positively influences both GenAI self-efficacy and valuing but only GenAI self-efficacy emerged as a significant mediator. The results expand the limited empirical scholarship on AI in school leadership, most of which is non-empirical. The results suggest that middle leaders’ confidence in their ability to use GenAI plays a critical role in their engagement with the technology and that organisational support helps promote GenAI adoption. Middle leaders’ GenAI self-efficacy was shown to play a key role in channelling the beneficial effect of school support on integration in practice. The results and their implications are discussed.</jats:p>"

The research employs a questionnaire-based approach, collecting responses from 439 participants and examining demographics, technological proficiency, utility perceptions, personal data concerns, attitudes towards artificial intelligence and generative artificial intelligence, and willingness to endorse technology adoption. The data analysis minimises discrepancies between predicted and actual values through multiple linear regression. In addition, statistical methods such as Spearman’s ρ, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test and chi-square statistics are employed to consolidate the findings, ensuring the thoroughness and validity of the research process. The results indicate a positive inclination among participants to perceive artificial intelligence as augmentative rather than a replacement in public usage contexts. The research’s originality lies in the unique contribution of employees to technology adoption and strategic knowledge asset renewal for the management in the public domain. </jats:p>"

Adaptive cancer therapy is in principle the most viable approach to manage cancer’s adaptive dynamics through drug combinations with dose timing and modulation. However, there are numerous open issues facing the clinical success of adaptive therapy. Chief among these issues is the feasibility of real-time predictions of treatment response which represent a bedrock requirement of adaptive therapy. Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to learn prediction models of treatment response from clinical, molecular, and radiomics data about patients and their treatments. The article explores this potential through a proposed integration model of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) in a closed loop with adaptive treatments to predict the trajectories of disease progression. The conceptual model and the challenges facing its realization are discussed in the broader context of artificial intelligence integration in oncology. </jats:p>"

            Image colorization is one of the core issues in computer vision that has attracted significant attention in recent years. Colorization technique improves the human eye’s ability to recognize grayscale images and understand scenes, particularly in low-light-level (LLL) images. However, current colorization methods still face issues, such as semantic confusion, color bleeding, and loss of image details. To address these issues, a bi-stream feature extraction and multiscale attention generative adversarial network (BM-GAN) is proposed. The bi-stream feature extraction block combines global and local features extracted from two parallel encoders. This combination improves the ability of the network to extract deep features from images. The multiscale attention block enhances key features related to the colorization target across channels and spatial dimensions. This results in higher-quality color images. The proposed method is evaluated on ImageNet, Summer2winter validation set, and LLL images. Experimental results show that BM-GAN reduces the feature-aware evaluation metrics learned perceptual image patch similarity and Fréchet inception distance by 5.2% and 7.5%, respectively.

The rise to prominence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in many realms of human activities is compelling the consideration of its capabilities as a potential lever to advance the development of effective cancer treatments. This article presents a hypothetical case study on the application of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) to the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). The case explores the design of GPT-supported adaptive intermittent therapy for mPC. Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are assumed to be repeatedly monitored while treatment may involve a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), androgen receptor-signalling inhibitors (ARSI), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The analysis covers various questions relevant to the configuration, training, and inferencing of GPTs for the case of mPC treatment with a particular attention to risk mitigation regarding the hallucination problem and its implications to clinical integration of GenAI technologies. The case study provides elements of an actionable pathway to the realization of GenAI-assisted adaptive treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. As such, the study is expected to help facilitate the design of clinical trials of GenAI-supported cancer treatments. </jats:p>"

This article asks: have GLMs acquired natural language? Employing Gadamer’s theory of language, I argue that they have not. While GLMs can reliably generate linguistic content that can be interpreted as “texts,” they lack the linguistically mediated reality that language provides. Missing from these models are four key features of a linguistic construction of reality: groundedness to the world, understanding, community, and tradition. I conclude with skepticism that GLMs can ever achieve natural language because they lack these characteristics in their linguistic development. </jats:p>"

Its focal point is Generative AI, a technology that puts so-called Large Language Models to work. The first part of the paper analyzes Generative AI, based as it is on the statistical probability of one token (a word or part of a word) following another. If the relation of tokens is meaningful, this is circumstantial and no more, because its mechanisms of statistical analysis eschew any theory of meaning. This is the case not only for the written text that Generative AI leverages, but by extension image and multimodal forms of meaning that it can generate. The AI can only work with non-textual forms of meaning after applying language labels, and to that extent is captive not only to the limits of probabilistic statistics but the limits of written language as well. While acknowledging gains arising from the brute statistical power of Generative AI, in its second part the paper goes on to map what is lost in its statistical and text-bound approaches to multimodal meaning-making. Our measure of these gains and losses is guided by the concept of grammar, defined here as a theory of the elemental patterns of meaning in the world—not just written text and speech, but also image, space, object, body, and sound. Ironically, a good deal of what is lost by Generative AI is computable. The third and final part of the paper briefly discusses educational applications of Generative AI. Given both its power and intrinsic limitations, we have been experimenting with the application of Generative AI in educational settings and the ways it might be put to pedagogical use. How does a grammatical analysis help us to identify the scope of worthwhile application? Finally, if more of human experience is computable than can be captured in text-bound AI, how might it be possible at the level of code to create a synthesis in which grammatical and multimodal approaches complement Generative AI? </jats:p>"

We use real-world consumer reviews and experiments to investigate differences between GenAI- and human-generated responses to reviews, and to assess how they affect consumer perceptions. Importantly, consumers are generally unable to distinguish responses generated by GenAI from human responses. However, transparency about GenAI use significantly alters consumer perceptions, often negatively, but this negative effect varies depending on the source of disclosure and consumers’ subjective knowledge about GenAI. We discuss the implications for consumer privacy, welfare, and public policy, emphasizing the need for transparent GenAI use in customer service, especially within sensitive sectors like healthcare.</jats:p>"

While the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model has been widely applied to various technologies, its applicability to generative artificial intelligence products, which present unique challenges and opportunities, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective strategies for promoting user acceptance and optimising the design of generative artificial intelligence tools. This study extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to investigate the factors influencing usage intention for generative artificial intelligence products. The study incorporates additional variables such as digital literacy, perceived risk and perceived trust to provide a more comprehensive framework. Using structural equation modelling to analyse survey data, the study found that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and perceived trust significantly and positively impact usage intention. In addition, digital literacy indirectly enhances usage intention through effort expectancy, while perceived risk negatively influences usage intention through reduced trust. Notably, facilitating conditions did not exhibit a significant effect on usage intention. These findings offer valuable insights for developers and researchers in the field of generative artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of user-friendly design, performance optimisation, and trust-building measures. By identifying key factors that drive user adoption, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of technology acceptance in the context of advanced artificial intelligence systems, paving the way for more effective development and implementation strategies in this rapidly evolving field. </jats:p>"

This article presents a narrative exploring the implementation of generative AI in nursing education and offers a guide for its strategic use. The exploration begins with an examination of the broader societal impact and uses of artificial intelligence, recognizing its pervasive presence and the potential it holds. Thematic analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats collected from nurse educators across the southeastern United States in this case-based descriptive study used four codes: time, innovation, critical thinking, and routine tasks. Findings from the qualitative analysis revealed the overarching themes that AI can serve as both a tool and a tyrant, offering opportunities for efficiency and innovation while posing challenges of transparency, ethical use, and AI literacy. By establishing ethical guidelines, fostering AI literacy, and promoting responsible implementation in nursing education with a clear articulation of expectations, nurse educators can guide and guard the use of generative AI. Despite the concerns, the transformative potential of generative AI to enhance teaching methodologies and prepare students for the interprofessional health-care workforce provides a multitude of innovative opportunities for teaching and learning. </jats:p>"

This study aims to explore determinants of AI hallucination exposure (HEX), examine the potential HEX's direct and mediating effects on adoption intentions, and integrate HEX into the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to advance generative AI adoption models. An eight-factor measurement model, grounded in the TPB and incorporating constructs such as perceived usefulness, attitude toward AI, perceived risk, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, user trust, AI hallucination exposure, and behavioral intention, was developed and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The study concludes that perceived behavioral control is a significant determinant of AI hallucination exposure (HEX), while subjective norms exert a direct influence on behavioral intention (BI) to adopt generative AI chatbots. AI hallucination exposure does not statistically significantly mediate the relationship between key antecedents and the use of generative AI chatbots. These findings advance the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by integrating AI-specific risks like HEX while underscoring the need to refine theoretical models to account for contexts where technological reliability—rather than user perceptions alone—drives adoption decisions.</jats:p>"

The study aims to identify the factors influencing AI literacy and its subsequent influence on consumers’ behavioral intentions toward seeking health information using generative AI chatbots. A nine-factor measurement model (INS, ISE, IFO, AIH, ANX, AVD, AIL, BI, AIC) was developed with the help of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and tested using structural equation modeling. The results of SEM analysis demonstrate that IFO (β = 0.138, CR = 2.731, p &lt; .05), ANX (β = 0.175, CR = 3.103, p &lt; .05), and AVD (β = 0.158, CR = 3.855, p &lt; .05) had a statistically positive significant influence on AI literacy. Similarly, BI (β = 0.128, CR = 2.423, p &lt; .05) had a statistically positive significant influence on AIC. A positive but non-significant effect of INS on AIL was also observed (β=0.058, CR = 1.006, p &gt; .05). AIL also had a positive but non-significant effect on BI (β=0.050, CR = 1.598, p &gt; .05).

The findings conclude that information overload, anxiety, and avoidance significantly influence AI literacy. On the other hand, information source exposure, AI hallucination, and information seeking do not significantly influence consumers’ AI literacy level. The study suggests that health professionals and staff could be equipped with better knowledge and skills related to AI applications in healthcare settings.</jats:p>"

However, little is known about how GenAI is being used in special education as well as the effects and challenges that might bring for learners with disabilities. To address this research gap, this study systematically reviews the literature on GenAI in special education. Specifically, it conducts a meta-synthesis of thirty-three studies based on Vygotsky's mediated-action model. The obtained results revealed that: (a) most of the studies on GenAI in special education are from the U.S. and the most targeted disability type is emotion/attention; (b) GenAI was mostly used as a pedagogical assistant; (c) although a quantitative synthesis on experimental studies indicated a huge effect (

Market researchers, social scientists, policymakers, government entities, public health researchers, and practitioners recognize the potential for social data to inspire innovation, support products and services, characterize public opinion, and guide decisions. The appeal of mining these rich datasets is clear. However, there is potential risk of data misuse, underscoring an equally huge and fundamental flaw in the research: there are no procedural standards and little transparency. Transparency across the processes of collecting and analyzing social media data is often limited due to proprietary algorithms. Spurious findings and biases introduced by artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate the challenges this lack of transparency poses for research. Social media research remains a virtual “wild west,” with no clear standards for reporting regarding data retrieval, preprocessing steps, analytic methods, or interpretation. Use of emerging generative AI technologies to augment social media analytics can undermine validity and replicability of findings, potentially turning this research into a “black box” enterprise. Clear guidance for social media analyses and reporting is needed to assure the quality of the resulting research. In this article, we propose criteria for evaluating the quality of studies using social media data, grounded in established scientific practice. We offer clear documentation guidelines to ensure that social data are used properly and transparently in research and applications. A checklist of disclosure elements to meet minimal reporting standards is proposed. These criteria will make it possible for scholars and practitioners to assess the quality, credibility, and comparability of research findings using digital data. </jats:p>"

Fundamental to the diagnosis and clinical surveillance is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows for the identification of T2-hyperintensities associated with autoimmune injury that demonstrate distinct spatial distribution patterns. Here, we describe the clinical experience of a 31-year-old, right-handed, White man seen in consultation at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, following complaints of headaches that began after head trauma related to military service. Imaging data spanning over 10 years are provided. All MRI data are currently presented in black and white with grayscale values within voxels associated with a single variable, intensity. We transformed these grayscale values into color using generative artificial intelligence (AI). As color allows for the inclusion of three variables: hue, lightness (intensity), and saturation, we hypothesized that additional details may be learned beyond those currently provided with the existing conventional approach of grayscale interpretation. We identified differences in lesion colors that remained consistent from the two MRI timepoints studied. In addition, quantitative R1, R2, and proton density voxel values appeared consistent with the color scheme generated by the AI system. With advancing AI methods and capabilities along with the additional data that color provides in comparison to grayscale, new insights into the biology of disease may be possible. Modifying what we measure in people with chronic conditions and how we present the data may be of greater value than conventional approaches typically used in the study, education, and care of people with MS and other neurological conditions. </jats:p>"

During the initial iteration of the applied research methodology, it was recognised that effective IoT platform configuration must extend beyond device registration to include the creation of scenario-specific rules. To address this, the

This work aims to measure the perception of GenAI among medical educators and to gain insights into its major advantages and concerns in medical education. A survey invitation was distributed to medical education faculty of colleges of allopathic and osteopathic medicine within a single university during the fall of 2023. The survey comprised 12 items, among those assessing the role of GenAI for students and educators, the need to modify teaching approaches, GenAI’s perceived advantages, applications of GenAI in the educational context, and the concerns, challenges, and trustworthiness associated with GenAI. Responses were obtained from 48 faculty. They showed a positive attitude toward GenAI and disagreed on GenAI having a very negative effect on either the students’ or faculty’s educational experience. Eighty-five percent of our medical schools’ faculty responded to had heard about GenAI, while 42% had not used it at all. Generating text (33%), automating repetitive tasks (19%), and creating multimedia content (17%) were some of the common utilizations of GenAI by school faculty.

As AI technologies develop, it becomes more important to investigate these new technologies as a subject to be included in educational levels. The contribution of AI to success in educational settings is closely linked to the preparation of teachers. On the other hand, AI is an important concept that should be learnt by all students regardless of their educational level. Therefore, it is important to understand how prepared future teachers are for AI learning to ensure the effective implementation of AI in schools. Furthermore, addressing the perceived threats and digital citizenship levels arising from the use of emerging AI-based technologies requires individuals to have effective AI-related knowledge, skills and values. The aim of this study is to reveal the relationship between pre-service teachers’ AI readiness levels and various variables. These variables are perceived threats from AI, AI-enhanced innovation, AI literacy, digital citizenship. A total of 816 pre-service teachers participated in the study. PLS-SEM was used to evaluate the relationships between the research variables. In addition, Multigroup Analysis (MGA) was applied to model sub-samples according to gender. It was found that AI-enhanced innovation levels were significantly affected by the dimensions of AI readiness: cognition, vision and ethics in teaching. Perceived threats from AI level was significantly affected by ability and ethics in teaching, which are the dimensions of AI readiness. Perceived threats from AI levels had a significant effect on AI literacy. AI-enhanced innovation was found to have a significant effect on AI literacy and digital citizenship. In addition, differences were found according to gender. The results of this study can also guide pre-professional development programs to be developed for pre-service teachers, which is an important factor to be considered in AI education.</jats:p>"

A meta-analysis of 49 articles showed that the mean effect sizes of GenAI on students’ learning achievement and learning motivation were 0.857 and 0.803, respectively, indicating a positive impact of GenAI on education. However, this effect varied according to moderators, including education level, subject classification, GenAI interface, GenAI development, interaction approaches, and experimentation time, which enhanced the impact of GenAI on education. Specifically, GenAI had a greater impact on the academic performance of higher education students, and students interacted more effectively with GenAI using text than with mixed media, such as images or audio. Although GenAI has a novel effect on students’ learning motivation, the effect size decreases over time. These findings provide empirical support for the beneficial effects of GenAI on education and offer insights for optimizing its use in teaching practices.</jats:p>"

            <jats:bold>Rationale and Objectives:</jats:bold>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly generative models, are increasingly used to depict clinical roles in healthcare. This study evaluates whether generative AI systems accurately differentiate between radiologists and medical radiation technologists (MRTs), 2 roles often confused by patients and providers.
            <jats:bold>Materials and Methods:</jats:bold>
            We assessed 1380 images and videos generated by 8 text-to-image/video AI models. Five raters evaluated task-role accuracy, attire, equipment, lighting, isolation, and demographics. Statistical tests compared differences across models and roles.
            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>
            MRTs were depicted accurately in 82.0% of outputs, while only 56.2% of radiologist images/videos were role-appropriate. Among inaccurate radiologist depictions, 79.1% misrepresented MRTs tasks. Radiologists were more often male (73.8%) and White (79.7%), while MRTs were more diverse. Stethoscope misuse, lack of disability/religious markers, and overuse of business attire for radiologists further reflected bias.
            <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>
            Generative AI frequently misrepresents radiologist roles and demographics, reinforcing stereotypes and public confusion. Greater oversight and inclusion standards are needed to ensure equitable AI-generated healthcare content.

We developed a 13-question survey using the REDCap application to explore participants’ educational background, year in school, preferred medical specialty, and perception of current or potential use of GenAI within residency applications. More than half of the responders have already used or plan to use GenAI for assistance in developing their personal statements for their applications. A considerable percentage (43.3%) will use GenAI to edit/modify a draft of the personal statement. More than half of survey participants believe that in the future, GenAI may alter the significance program directors place on letters of recommendation (LORs) in their selection criteria for deciding who to interview and select. Our survey results indicate that a number of students are either using or are receptive to the idea of using GenAI to draft or refine certain components of their residency application, such as the personal statement and impactful experiences section.

Hence, we simulate “interviews” with ChatGPT and reconstruct how it presents science, science communication, scientific misbehavior, and controversial scientific issues. Combining qualitative and quantitative content analysis, we find that, generally, ChatGPT portrays science largely as the STEM disciplines, in a positivist-empiricist way and a positive light. When comparing ChatGPT’s responses to different simulated user profiles and responses from the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions, we find similarities in that the scientific consensus on questions such as climate change, COVID-19 vaccinations, or astrology is consistently conveyed across them.

Specifically, some of the core symbolic problems are provably hard, hence a general NSI system necessarily needs to adopt this computational complexity, too.

            Generative artificial intelligence (Gen.AI) is capable of significantly improving the breadth and depth of structured literature reviews (SLRs). However, its inclusion raises essential questions regarding the review’s methodology, quality, and ethical implications. Previous research predominantly focused on the capabilities and limitations of Gen.AI to establish guidelines for research practices. However, the rapid evolution of Gen.AI often outpaces the publication of methodological papers. In response, our study adopts a criteria-centric approach, scrutinizing the scientific quality standards that Gen.AI must meet. In other words, instead of discussing
            <jats:italic>what Gen.AI can and cannot do</jats:italic>

From this, we synthesize a unified process and criterion set, not only underpinning a comprehensive understanding of the extant SLR methodologies but also serving as the foundational framework for integrating Gen.AI. Second, we delineate the specific scenarios conducive to incorporating Gen.AI into this fundamental framework, as well as situations where its integration may not be suitable. Our contribution is further solidified by providing a detailed, step-by-step guide—akin to a “cooking recipe”—to effectively integrate Gen.AI in SLRs, ensuring adherence to established quality criteria.

The aim is to offer AI systems the ability to learn from human revision but also assist humans at evaluating AI capabilities. The proposed method allows users and domain experts to learn about the data-driven decision making process of large neural network models and to impose a particular behaviour onto such models. The models are queried using a symbolic logic language that acts as a lingua franca between humans and model representations. Interaction with the user then confirms or rejects a revision of the model using logical constraints that can be distilled back into the neural network. We illustrate the approach using the Logic Tensor Network framework alongside Concept Activation Vectors and apply it to Convolutional Neural Networks and the task of achieving quantitative fairness. Our results illustrate how the use of a logical language is able to provide users with a formalisation of the model’s decision making whilst allowing users to steer the model towards a given alignment constraint.</jats:p>

It explored how factors like learners’ ideal L2 self-imagination, international posture, and perceptions of information quality influence their engagement with productive (e.g., writing, speaking) and receptive (e.g., reading, listening) informal digital learning activities mediated by generative AI. Drawing from theories of consumption values and self-determination, the research model examined relationships between these variables. The findings suggest that while generative AI holds promise for informal digital language learning by facilitating imagination of an ideal multilingual self, there are opportunities to enhance functionality for L2 contexts. Nurturing an international mindset through interventions may also promote informal learning across genders. Adapting informal digital learning resources based on factors like information quality perceptions could increase engagement.

However, it still remains difficult for human experts to understand how such results are achieved, due to the “black box” nature of the deep models used. In high-stake decision making scenarios such as the interpretation of medical imaging for diagnostics, such a lack of transparency still hinders the adoption of these techniques in practice. In this position paper we present a conceptual methodology for the design of a neuro-symbolic cycle to address the need for explainability and confidence (including trust) of deep learning models when used to support human experts in high-stake decision making, and we discuss challenges and opportunities in the implementation of such cycle as well as its adoption in real world scenarios. We elaborate on the need to leverage the potential of hybrid artificial intelligence combining neural learning and symbolic reasoning in a human-centered approach to explainability. We advocate that the phases of such a cycle should include i) the extraction of knowledge from a trained network to represent and encode its behaviour, ii) the validation of the extracted knowledge through commonsense and domain knowledge, iii) the generation of explanations for human experts, iv) the ability to map human feedback into the validated representation from i), and v) the injection of some of this knowledge in a non-trained network to enable knowledge-informed representation learning. The holistic combination of causality, expressive logical inference, and representation learning, would result in a seamless integration of (neural) learning and (cognitive) reasoning that makes it possible to retain access to the inherently explainable symbolic representation without losing the power of the deep representation. The involvement of human experts in the design, validation and knowledge injection process is crucial, as the conceptual approach paves the way for a new human–ai paradigm where the human role goes beyond that of labeling data, towards the validation of neural-cognitive knowledge and processes.</jats:p>"

However, most existing human-computer collaborative programming learning is supported by traditional computers with a relatively low level of personalized interaction, which greatly limits the efficiency of students’ efficiency of programming learning and development of computational thinking. To address the above issues, this study introduces generative AI into human-computer collaborative programming learning and proposes a dialogue-negotiated human-computer collaborative programming learning method based on generative AI. The method focuses on the problems-solving process and constructs multiple agents through Prompt design, which enable students to improve their computational thinking and master programming skills in the process of human-computer interaction for problem-solving. Finally, a quasi-experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in a 10th grade computer programming course in a high school. 43 students in the experimental group learned with the proposed method, while 42 students in the control group adopted the traditional computer-supported human-computer collaborative programming learning method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method more significantly improved students’ computational thinking, programming learning attitudes, and learning achievement.

However, existing methods still face major challenges in style controllability, emotion consistency, and user satisfaction prediction. This study proposes a multimodal AI art generation strategy based on Stable Diffusion and BERT, using ControlNet, text-to-image (T2I)-Adapter, style–emotion mapping (SEM), sentiment prediction optimization, guided score distillation (GSD), and score-based generative model (SGM) to achieve high-quality, personalized art generation. First, ControlNet and T2I-Adapter are introduced into the Stable Diffusion method to enhance the fine control of text descriptions, visual references, and style labels, and improve the controllability and emotion consistency of generated content. In addition, a SEM model is constructed to establish a deep correspondence between user emotions and visual aesthetics using multimodal feature learning (including color, composition, and style attributes). Afterwards, GSD and SGM are used to optimize the diffusion model to minimize the interference of irrelevant information and ensure high-quality, emotion-consistent art output. The test results show that this method has significant advantages in style controllability, user emotion consistency, and satisfaction prediction accuracy, and provides new ideas for personalized art design, emotion-driven content generation, and optimization of human–computer interaction experience.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we explore the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT to address core problems of the ASWB exams, including the use of a multiple-choice format that does not reflect real-world social work practice. To assess its social work reasoning, we used ChatGPT to answer ASWB-developed practice questions for the Bachelors, Masters, and Clinical exams. ChatGPT scored 76%, 80%, and 64%, respectively, and identified additional validity challenges. Based on this performance, we provide a proof-of-concept for how generative AI might move us toward a more valid and equitable exam. While we strongly support licensure requirements, state regulators and legislators should temporarily suspend the use of the ASWB exams for this purpose. </jats:p>"

GenAI tools include chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) and may be particularly attractive to patients and caregivers for their wide accessibility and potential to improve access to information. However, since these tools’ quality parameters (i.e., accuracy) have been shown to be problematic, a deeper understanding of what contributes to patients’ and caregivers’ trust of GenAI tools is needed. Thus, we conducted a review of empirical literature to identify correlates of trust in GenAI tools among patients and caregivers. Based on 24 studies, there is emerging evidence that there is a moderate level of trust of GenAI among patients. No studies examined caregivers. We inductively identified five groupings of factors that contribute to patients’ trust of GenAI. These were individuals (e.g., health literacy, trait trust), tasks (e.g., administrative vs. diagnosis), agent design (e.g., personalization), agent implementation (e.g., government oversight), and agent performance (e.g., reliability). This review suggests that multi-level factors influence patients’ trust in GenAI agents. Additional research is needed on caregivers, publicly accessible GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), and developing and validating trust in GenAI instruments.</jats:p>"

            The widespread integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our daily lives has spurred an escalating demand for explainable AI (XAI). This demand is particularly pronounced in critical domains such as healthcare and finance, where understanding the decision-making processes of AI models is paramount. Despite noteworthy strides in XAI, prevailing approaches often neglect the crucial dimension of context, resulting in explanations that are challenging to comprehend and act upon for different stakeholders. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift towards context-sensitive explainability, tailoring explanations to users’ specific needs and understanding promoting inclusivity and accessibility. We propose a novel context taxonomy and a versatile framework, “ConEX” for developing context-sensitive explanations using any state-of-the-art post hoc explainer. Our empirical user study highlights diverse preferences for contextualization levels, emphasizing the importance of catering to these preferences to build trust and satisfaction in AI systems. Our contributions extend beyond the theoretical realm, offering practical guidance for developing context-sensitive explanations that are tailored to the specific needs of diverse stakeholders. By embracing context-sensitive explainability, we can unlock the true potential of AI, fostering trust, transparency, and informed decision-making across various domains.

However, in domains where data is scarce or sensitive, ML models often exhibit sub-optimal performance. Our hypothesis is that semantically enriching the available training dataset can enhance the predictive power of ML models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose novel neuro-symbolic approaches that augment tabular data with knowledge graph (KG) information, providing additional context and structure to improve model performance. Concretely, we introduce and examine several integration techniques of KG information through embeddings and explore how different KG embedding algorithms affect model performance, with a specific focus on accuracy and F2 scores. Our evaluation involves four distinct ML algorithms and four KG embedding techniques. We apply our approach to binary classification tasks on tabular data, including heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Our experimental results show improvements in performance particularly when tabular data is augmented with distance features computed in the embedding space. Notably, we achieve gains in F2 scores, such as an increase in XGBoost performance from 75.19% to 90.85% for heart disease prediction.

In this paper, we argue that requirements definition and satisfaction can go a long way to make machine learning models even more fitting to the real world, especially in critical domains. To this end, we present two problems in which (i) requirements arise naturally, (ii) machine learning models are or can be fruitfully deployed, and (iii) neglecting the requirements can have dramatic consequences. Our proposed pyramid development process integrates requirements specification into every stage of the machine learning pipeline, ensuring mutual influence between requirements and subsequent phases. Additionally, we explore the pivotal role of Neuro-symbolic AI in facilitating this integration, paving the way for more reliable and robust machine learning applications in critical domains.

Firstly, a dual behavior learning module is designed, where the role-based behavior learning submodule constructs graphlet degree vector by identifying four self-isomorphic orbits to capture deep structural features, while the attribute-based behavior learning submodule obtains attribute vectors through graph convolutional network. Then, the results are combined in the dynamic edge representation module to form the dynamic representations of edges to capture dual behavior patterns. Lastly, the anomaly detection module is designed to detect newly generated edges by combining contrastive learning with gated recurrent unit. We conduct experiments from four perspectives: anomaly detection accuracy, parameter sensitivity, robustness of module variants, and model runtime efficiency. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a peak accuracy of 92.05% in the task of dynamic edge anomaly detection.</jats:p>"

The attention mechanisms in transformers mimicking human visual attention allocation, thereby enhancing the processing capabilities and comprehension of long video sequences. However, they often overlook the aggregation of multiscale detail features and the hierarchical representations of early visual information. Additionally, attention networks are computationally intensive and parameter-heavy, complicating model training and extending inference times, rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications. To crack these nuts, we propose a lightweight multiscale action recognition model based on convolutional enhancement block (ConvEB) and multiscale average pooling encoder. The ConvEB aims to establish long-range dependencies among multiscale local features in the early stages of the network, providing effective inductive biases for the attention network to compensate for the loss of detailed information. Moreover, we introduce a parallel pooling mixer to replace the original attention mixer, ensuring model lightweight while maintaining recognition accuracy. Finally, we deploy this model in the construction of a virtual panorama live broadcasting system. Experimental results demonstrate that our action recognition algorithm achieves competitive performance, and the constructed panoramic system basically meets the needs of daily live broadcasting.</jats:p>"

            The predicates used for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems are usually elusive and need to be hand-crafted in advance, which limits the generalization of the system when learning new rules without sufficient background knowledge. Predicate Invention (PI) for ILP is the problem of discovering new concepts that describe hidden relationships in the domain. PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic rules. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for Neuro-Symbolic-ILP (NeSy-ILP) systems that can handle 3D visual inputs to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is still unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach, NeSy-

A feed-forward multilayer neural network has been applied to a case study of pine forests of Castilla La Mancha (Central–Eastern Spain), where seed germination and seedling survival, with or without seed protection, of four pine species ( Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Pinus halepensis, and Pinus sylvestris) were observed throughout 10 years under three soil conditions (scalped, wildfire-affected, and unaltered soils).

            In this article, we present an approach to enrich transformers with additional information for general classification tasks given a set of relevant helper labels. We investigate whether the addition of preselected emotions as relevant helper labels can improve sentiment classification using BERT and DistilBERT. This method generates zero-shot labels like emotions for sentiment, and uses them as auxiliary text and classifier inputs to contribute to the final sentiment prediction. The approach has shown improvements in F1 score primarily for small datasets (1,000–50,000 samples). We also found that large, difficult-to-improve datasets such as the Sentiment140 dataset, with 1.6 million samples, also benefited from our approach. We tested the improvements on a smaller dataset, specifically an airline dataset comprising over 11,500 samples, and on subsamples of the Sentiment140 dataset with sizes ranging from 500 to 50,000. We conducted an ablation study on the zero-shot labels, which indicated that more labels generally improve the model. Our results show improvements in all cases over the original model for both BERT and DistilBERT when tested with added emotion inputs generated from zero-shot pretrained models.

We implemented a scoring system to enhance the performance of a few-shot training. This involves constructing finely tuned prompts composed of dialog samples with the highest scores. The scoring process is grounded in a set of heuristics that specifically assess the structure and content of the dialogs.

In turn, classical description logics reasoners cannot be applied as no useful inference results can be generated in the face of inconsistencies. Meanwhile, classical reasoners can be used in order to retrieve the inconsistency explanations, but as the KG size grows larger the required time for this task increases significantly.

In terms of determining sensitive attributes, existing studies tend to rely too heavily on sociological knowledge and neglect the importance of exploring potential sensitive attributes directly from the data itself. The accuracy of this approach is limited when dealing with data that cannot be fully explained by sociological factors. Regarding data bias correction, existing methods are primarily categorized into causality-based and association-based methods. The former requires a deep understanding of the underlying causal structure in the dataset, which is often difficult to achieve in practice. The latter method correlates sensitive attributes with algorithmic results through statistical measures, but this approach often tends to ignore the impact of sensitive attributes on other attributes. In this paper, we formalize the identification of sensitive attributes as a problem solvable through data analysis, without relying on commonly recognized knowledge in social science. We also propose a data pre-processing method that considers the effects of attributes correlated with sensitive attributes to enhance algorithmic fairness by combining the association-based bias reduction method. We evaluated our proposed method on a public dataset. The evaluation results indicate that our method can accurately identify sensitive attributes and improve the fairness of machine learning algorithms compared to existing methods.</jats:p>"

In the diffusion model architecture, this paper adds the nonlinear learnable activation function Kolmogorov–Arnold network to the noise estimation network U-Net to generate higher quality enhanced images.

            This paper presents exact local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (ELIME) algorithm for explainable machine learning, which provides a comprehensible explanation of the decision-making process and predictions of machine learning models. Building upon existing model-agnostic interpretation methods, our approach enhances feature importance evaluation through single-feature sensitivity analysis and introduces a weighted distance metric based on sensitivity values. This sensitivity information is utilized for both calculating distances and generating training data for model fitting, improving the quality and reliability of the explanations. The enhanced ELIME algorithm is particularly effective for tabular classification domains, offering explanations that closely resemble the decision boundaries of the model. Comparative analysis with local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME), deterministic LIME (DLIME), and active learning-based DLIME (AL-DLIME) demonstrates that while ELIME achieves superior fidelity and accuracy compared to DLIME and AL-DLIME, its stability is lower. However, ELIME outperforms LIME across all three metrics.

But even though a central concern of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is to combine neural learning with symbolic reasoning, relatively little neurosymbolic research focuses on leveraging the logical representation and reasoning capabilities of Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based KGs. The objective of this position article is to inspire more neurosymbolic researchers to embrace the OWL and the Semantic Web by raising awareness of the benefits, capabilities, and applications of OWL-based KGs, particularly with respect to logical reasoning. We describe the ecosystem of open W3C standards-based resources available that support the adoption and use of OWL-based KGs; we describe tools that exist for engineering custom OWL ontologies tailored to particular research needs; we discuss the encoding of background KG knowledge in subsymbolic embedding spaces and various applications of this approach; we discuss and illustrate the reasoning capabilities of OWL-based KGs; and we describe several promising directions for research that focus on leveraging these reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the specialised resources needed to undertake research on OWL-based KGs in neurosymbolic systems. We use the example of NeSy4VRD, an image dataset with a custom-designed companion OWL ontology. The scarcity of this kind of resource should be addressed to accelerate research in this field.

Our research aims to enhance theater accessibility using computer vision techniques to detect visual information about objects and actor gestures and convey them to blind audiences through non-visual modalities. In this work, we focus on providing a novel dataset, TS-RGBD, containing theater scenes to guide the development of computer-vision-based systems for theater scene description. It includes RGB, depth, and skeleton sequences captured by Microsoft Kinect in a theatrical setting. The dataset features untrimmed theater scenes as well as trimmed sequences consisting of individual gestures for actor gesture recognition. We test state-of-the-art image captioning models on untrimmed scenes, revealing that dense captioning models generate redundant captions with fixed numbers, leading to imprecise descriptions and a lack of context. These challenges hinder visually impaired individuals from comprehending theater scenes descriptions effectively. Additionally, we assess the performance of skeleton-based graph convolution networks for human action recognition in a theater environment using trimmed skeleton sequences. The results highlight limitations in recognizing human actions in this setting. Based on these findings, we propose solutions for overcoming these challenges, paving the way for future improvements in making theater performances more accessible to individuals with visual impairments.</jats:p>"

It explores how scene graph generation, a process that detects and analyses objects, visual relationships and attributes in scenes, serves as a symbolic scene representation. This representation forms the basis for higher-level visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, image retrieval, image generation, and multimodal event processing. Infusing common sense knowledge, particularly through the use of heterogeneous knowledge graphs, improves the accuracy, expressiveness and reasoning ability of the representation and allows for intuitive downstream reasoning. Neurosymbolic integration in these approaches ranges from loose to tight coupling of neural and symbolic components.

However, the usage of AI is prone to bias and misinformation and can be used to manipulate. Therefore, various lawmakers such as the European Union aim to enforce AI disclosure messages to protect consumers. But the implications of such disclosures have not yet been studied. This paper draws on existing theories in persuasion knowledge, disclosure theory, inferences of manipulative intent, and AI aversion to develop a model to understand consumer attitudes toward AI disclosures in Instagram advertisements. A three-condition between-subjects online experiment ( N<jats:sub>final</jats:sub>  = 161) was conducted to test the model. The data were analyzed using a moderated mediation model. AI disclosures lead to a direct decrease in advertising attitude. In addition, AI disclosures lead to a decrease in brand attitude only when consumers have high AI aversion. There were no effects of AI disclosures on source credibility. These effects were mediated by inferences of manipulative intent. However, participants who viewed the AI disclosure had lower inferences of manipulative intent and then participants who did not view the AI disclosure. Furthermore, no differences were found between AI disclosures pertaining to the use of AI in the creation of the image or the text. Implications are discussed from both theoretical and managerial viewpoints and highlight why the use of AI on social media for advertising purposes should be limited as it will become more transparent in the future. </jats:p>"

However, these performance improvements often come at a high computational cost, which limits their practical application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dual-branch SR model (DBSR) that enhances both model performance and efficiency through primary and auxiliary branches. The primary branch integrates the advantages of channel recalibration, a separable swin transformer (SST), and a spatial refinement module to achieve fine-grained feature extraction. The SST serves as the core of the primary branch, employing hierarchical window attention calculations to facilitate lightweight and effective multiscale feature representation. Conversely, the auxiliary branch enhances shallow features through a global information enhancement module, which mitigates the misleading effects of directly upsampling these shallow features on the SR results. Comparative and ablation experiments conducted on four RSI datasets and five SR benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DBSR method effectively balances the number of parameters with performance, showcasing its potential for application in RSI processing. </jats:p>"

We consider a variant of the p-median problem where distance constraints exist between facilities and between facilities and demand points. This problem can be used to model the requirements that arise when locating semi-obnoxious facilities. We first introduce integer linear programming and constraint programming (CP) models and implement them in Gurobi and OR-Tools, respectively. Then, we describe a greedy heuristic that can be used to prune branches during a search within an incomplete CP solver. We also introduce a number of domain-specific value ordering heuristics that can be applied within such a solver. The developed method is evaluated under different problem generation models, and compared to Gurobi and OR-Tools. The results demonstrate that our method is more robust than the two complete solvers, significantly outperforming either of them in certain classes of problems, both in terms of run times and the quality of the solutions found.</jats:p>"

            In recent years, vision-language pretraining (VLP) models have become a crucial driving force in the advancement of artificial intelligence. Besides, studies such as contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated that incorporating prompt learning within VLP models can significantly enhance the performance of downstream tasks. However, we believe that CLIP’s visual encoder suffers from feature extraction bias in image classification tasks, which is because of the uneven quantity and distribution of image features CLIP learned between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. This can be further summarized as an inherent bias in feature extraction for differently distributed samples during the pretraining phase. To address the above problem this paper proposes (i) text-semantic hierarchical injection prompt learning method, which constructs self-attention layers and prompt mapping structures and injects text semantic features into the visual encoder layer by layer to generate visual prompt features and (ii) visual-semantic attention interactive prompt learning method, which further integrates text embeddings with the output features of the visual encoder through cross-attention and constructs instance-level text prompt features for each image. Based on the two above methods, this paper further proposes the multimodal coupling prompt learning CLIP (MCPL-CLIP) to enhance CLIP’s performance in image classification tasks. Experiments conducted on 15 image classification datasets demonstrate that MCPL-CLIP outperforms baseline models such as MaPLe, CoCoOp, and CoOp in cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, and base-to-novel class generalization tasks, showcasing its superior text semantic representation and visual feature extraction capabilities.

            Distributed sparse block codes (SBCs) exhibit compact representations for encoding and manipulating symbolic data structures using fixed-width vectors. One major challenge however is to disentangle, or factorize, the distributed representation of data structures into their constituent elements without having to search through all possible combinations. This factorization becomes more challenging when SBCs vectors are noisy due to perceptual uncertainty and approximations made by modern neural networks to generate the query SBCs vectors. To address these challenges, we first propose a fast and highly accurate method for factorizing a more flexible and hence generalized form of SBCs, dubbed GSBCs. Our iterative factorizer introduces a threshold-based nonlinear activation, conditional random sampling, and an

We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on four deep CNN architectures over CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and RAVEN datasets. In all use cases, the number of parameters and operations are notably reduced compared to the FCL.

Various factors, including human error and machine failure, contribute to the emergence of missing values in datasets. Datasets containing missing values not only consume storage space but also pose a significant obstacle to direct utilization, resulting in substantial resource wastage. Consequently, accurately imputing missing values has emerged as a focal point in research. Generative missing value imputation methods, leveraging generative models, have demonstrated notable efficacy in recent years by directly generating values for missing components based on observable data values. This paper introduces a novel generative method for missing value imputation based on a diffusion denoising model, termed the conditional diffusion model for missing value imputation (CDMVI). Specifically, CDMVI trains a conditional diffusion model using complete data samples (samples devoid of missing values) and subsequently utilizes the trained model to impute missing values in datasets. During the training stage (i.e., the forward process of the diffusion model), a subset of features is randomly selected from complete data samples, and varying levels of random noise are introduced as condition inputs to the noise predictor within the diffusion model. In the imputation stage (i.e., the backward process of the diffusion model), the missing segments of the data are initially replaced with random noise, serving as a guide for the diffusion model to generate complete samples. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed CDMVI method. </jats:p>"

            The degradation of images captured in hazy weather can severely affect practical applications. However, most existing learning-based methods ignore the varied haze distribution in an image, resulting in incomplete dehazing of some areas. Also, the presence of haze can blur the textures and details, which will heavily impact the subsequent image processing. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based framework for dehazing tasks called HITFormer. Firstly, we introduce a texture recovery and enhance module as a preprocess to strengthen details. Then, we propose an adaptive haze intensity prediction subnet to predict the haze intensity of different areas. Lastly, we use a semantic-based luminance and chrominance adjustment module to fuse the feature maps in YUV color space and form a transformation coefficient to get a recovery image. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our HITFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on several image dehazing datasets.

In contrast, progressive media often highlight crisis value frames, focusing on issues like side effects, ethical concerns, and legislation surrounding AI. These partisan differences reflect fundamental societal priorities and influence public discourse and policy agendas. Understanding media framing is crucial for fostering informed public dialogue on the societal significance of AI and promoting evidence-based decision-making. By recognizing partisan biases and critically evaluating media coverage, citizens can engage in constructive discourse beyond ideological divides.

            Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify objects seamlessly embedded in the surrounding environment. Due to the high inherent similarity between the texture of the camouflaged object and its complex background, making COD far more challenging than traditional target detection. To solve these problems, we propose a method that uses holistic boundary information to optimize COD through a two-stage strategy. Specifically, the feature enhancement module is initially implemented to refine features at different scales and emphasize boundary details of camouflaged entities. Then, our network employs a boundary localization module to guide low-level local edge features through high-level global semantic. Furthermore, the boundary-embedded feature aggregation module is introduced to achieve cross-level fusion of multi-scale features, by embedding and effectively activating boundary information, which reduces the interference from cluttered backgrounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the other 17 state-of-the-art COD methods. The source code and results of our method are available at

            Image compression is crucial for reducing storage and transmission costs, particularly in applications involving high-resolution and complex imagery. Traditional compression methods, such as JPEG, PNG, and newer lossless formats like JPEG XL and WebP, often suffer from suboptimal compression ratios (CRs) and image quality when handling modern high-definition content. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based lossless image compression method. The symmetrical transformer (STF) model is introduced, integrating transformer blocks in both the downsampling encoder and upsampling decoder to enhance the capture of local and global features. The model also includes a multivariate mixture distribution channel conditioning (MMCC) entropy model, which improves pixel dependency predictions by modeling complex relationships within image channels. Additionally, an automated searching of optimal kernel shapes (SOKS) is employed to dynamically configure kernel sizes, optimizing the convolutional layers for different image regions. The system also applies stripe-wise pruning (SWP), which selectively prunes unimportant features during compression, reducing computational complexity and memory usage without compromising image quality. Extensive evaluations on standard datasets, including Kodak, CLIC, and DIV2K, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Specifically, the approach achieves significant compression efficiency, with bits-per-dimension (BPD) values of 3.06 on Kodak, 3.91 on CLIC, and 3.63 on DIV2K, outperforming traditional methods such as iVPF (3.20 BPD on Kodak), GOLLIC (3.15 BPD on Kodak), and MSPSM (3.12 BPD on Kodak). In addition to compression efficiency, the proposed method excels in inference speed, with encoding times as low as 7.80 ms per sample on Kodak, significantly faster than competing methods. These results demonstrate a substantial improvement in compression rates and image reconstruction quality, highlighting the model's potential for real-world applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and real-time streaming, offering a significant advancement in lossless image compression.

            In recent years, pervasive use of sensors in smart devices, e.g., phones, watches, medical devices, has increased dramatically the availability of personal data. However, existing research on data collection primarily focuses on the objective view of reality, as provided, for instance, by sensors, often neglecting the integration of subjective human input, as provided, for instance, by user answers to questionnaires. This limits substantially the exploitability of the collected data. In this paper, we present a methodology and a platform designed for the collection of a combination of large-scale sensor data and qualitative human feedback. The methodology has been designed to be deployed on top, and enrich functionalities of an existing data collection APP, called iLog, which has been used in large scale, worldwide data collection experiments. The main goal is to put the key actors involved in an experiment, i.e., the researcher in charge, the participant, and iLog in better control of the experiment itself, thus improving the quality and richness of the data collected. The novel functionalities of the resulting platform are: (i) a time-wise representation of the situational context within which the data collection is performed, (ii) an explicit representation of the temporal context within which the data collection is performed, (iii) a calendar-based dashboard for the real-time monitoring of the data collection context(s), and, (iv) a mechanism for the run-time revision of the data collection plan. The practicality and utility of the proposed functionalities are demonstrated in a case study involving 350 University students.

In this paper, we propose a novel method called irrelevant visual information suppression, which aims to alleviate the interference of irrelevant visual information in images on manipulation detection feature extraction, thereby obtaining generic manipulation traces that are more subtle and unrelated to semantic visual information. In general, most manipulation operations leave traces at manipulation edges. Therefore, we introduce a specially designed manipulated edge information enhancement branch aimed at identifying these edge artifacts more accurately. We construct a dual-branch network, where each branch uses ResNet-50 as the backbone to capture as many multi-scale manipulation features as possible. Finally, we adopt a multi-view feature learning method that combines the manipulated edge information enhancement branch with the irrelevant visual information suppression branch and is trained with multi-scale (pixel/edge/image/irrelevant visual information suppression) supervision. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments using five image manipulation localization datasets, including CASIAv1, CASIAv2, COVER, Columbia, and NIST16. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in terms of F1 score.

To solve this problem, we propose a highly efficient pillar-based model named MASNet, which mainly consists of a pillar mix attention (PMA) module, an attention-pooling operation, and a focal sparse network (FSN) module. The PMA module encodes the pillar features by fusion of the point-wise attention module and the channel-wise attention module. The attention-pooling operation aggregates the attention-encoded pillar features in a more comprehensive way to obtain the most expressive pillar features. In addition, the FSN module exploits the intrinsic sparsity of the data by introducing focal sparse convolution, which enriches the learned pillar features in the foreground without adding redundant pillars in other regions. On the KITTI three-dimensional (3D) Object Detection Benchmark, it achieves a 3D average precision of (77.81%, 60.30%, and 53.92%) in easy, moderate, and hard levels, which outperforms other pillar-based methods for the detection of cyclists.

This becomes even more striking when considering that ethical artificial intelligence development has the aim to be human-centric and of benefit for the whole society. In this study, we investigate how ethical principles (explainability, fairness, security, accountability, accuracy, privacy, and machine autonomy) are weighted in comparison to each other. This is especially important, since simultaneously considering ethical principles is not only costly, but sometimes even impossible, as developers must make specific trade-off decisions. In this paper, we give first answers on the relative importance of ethical principles given a specific use case—the use of artificial intelligence in tax fraud detection. The results of a large conjoint survey ([Formula: see text]) suggest that, by and large, German respondents evaluate the ethical principles as equally important. However, subsequent cluster analysis shows that different preference models for ethically designed systems exist among the German population. These clusters substantially differ not only in the preferred ethical principles but also in the importance levels of the principles themselves. We further describe how these groups are constituted in terms of sociodemographics as well as opinions on artificial intelligence. Societal implications, as well as design challenges, are discussed. </jats:p>"

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a text-to-image generation method (cascaded structure and joint attention generative adversarial network (CSGAN)) that combines cascaded structure and joint attention. After encoding the text, this method utilizes a conditional enhancement module to process it, which enhances the expressive ability of the text features. In order to make the local area of the image better fit the text features, this method designs a joint attention module to solve the problem that the image generation process cannot fully reflect the local details of the text content. By using affine transform mapping visual features and cascade structure to fuse the features of different modules, the integrity of the whole content of the image is effectively guaranteed and the semantic consistency of the text image is improved. Experimental results on the CUB dataset show that compared with the current mainstream non-stacked network model DF-GAN model, the inception score index of the CSGAN model is improved by about 4.01%, and the Fréchet inception distance index is reduced by about 13.36%. These data indicators and visualization results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSGAN model.</jats:p>"

The research community has examined a range of approaches to address this issue. However, most of these approaches are for a comparatively limited set of languages, especially English. Research on semantic word similarity for South Asian languages, particularly Urdu, is immature. In recent years, transformer-based approaches have proved extremely successful for a range of language processing tasks. The primary aim of this study is to develop and compare a variety of transformer-based approaches to the cross-lingual English–Urdu semantic word similarity task. This study evaluated a publicly available benchmark USWS-19 corpus that comprises 518 word pairs. This study mainly explored four types of transformer-based approaches: (a) cross-lingual sentence transformer-based approaches using the original dataset, (b) cross-lingual sentence transformer-based approaches using the translated dataset (translation plus monolingual analysis [T+MA] approach), (c) the feature fusion approach (mixture of features), and large language models. In addition, this study also explores the word embedding-based approach using the translated dataset (T+MA approach). In total, this study developed 29 transformer-based models, with the highest results (Pearson correlation = 0.788) achieved using a feature fusion approach, that is, Best-Two-SBERT (where SBERT stands for sentence-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers; using T+MA) + BEST Baseline (with Bing translator) + Best cross-lingual SBERT.

            With the advancement of technology, the demand for healthy eating has increased, making food classification a research hotspot. Existing deep learning-based food image classification models demonstrate high accuracy but require substantial computational resources, limiting their use on resource-constrained devices. In this study, a lightweight convolutional neural network model named MSNet for food classification is proposed. MSNet mainly consists of M Blocks and S Blocks. The M Block uses improved depthwise convolution to reduce the computational cost of conventional convolutions, and the S Block uses channel shuffle techniques to enhance feature information flow between channels without increasing additional computation, effectively capturing relationships between different channel features. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (ETHZ Food-101, Vireo Food-172, and ISIA Food-500) show that MSNet achieves top-1 accuracies of 86.24%, 87.98%, and 65.70%, with model sizes of 13.8 MB, 15.9 MB, and 25.4 MB, respectively, outperforming mainstream models in terms of computational efficiency. Further quantization produces two MSNet-Lite variants with competitive model size, while maintaining high accuracy and significantly improving inference speed. Additionally, visualization analysis indicates that MSNet effectively extracts essential features of food images, offering good interpretability and generalization across datasets of varying complexity. The proposed MSNet model provides a feasible solution for practical deployment in food classification tasks on mobile and embedded devices.

However, the heterogeneity of multimodal signals poses a challenge in learning modality representation and fusing information. To address it, the BiMSA (multimodal sentiment analysis based on BiGRU and bidirectional interactive attention) is proposed in this paper. In the modality representation learning layer, BiMSA incorporates a structure consisting of BiGRU to extract contextual information from video and audio inputs. Subsequently, modality features are projected into modality internal representations and interactive representations for extracting information. This practice allows the model to take into account more aspects of modality information. In terms of the modality fusion layer, a bidirectional interactive attention mechanism is used to focus on the key representations of key modalities, and integrate multimodal information flexibly and efficiently. Attention weights are concentrated on modality representations that synergistically contribute toward overall sentiment orientation. Additionally, the constraints of similarity loss and difference loss are introduced to align with representations while mitigating redundant information and achieving a better fusion effect. Experimental results on public datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI) demonstrate the effectiveness of the BiMSA model.</jats:p>"

SAM-YOLO incorporates the simple attention mechanism into the YOLOv7 network, allowing for the capture of more detailed information without introducing additional parameters. In this study, we experimentally redesigned the backbone network of SAM-YOLO by replacing the redundant part of the network layer with the C3 module, resulting in improved model performance while maintaining accuracy. The experimental results show that the SAM-YOLO algorithm performs excellently in several evaluation metrics under conventional conditions, especially outperforming other algorithms in accuracy and mean average precision values. In tests on the ExLight dataset facing extreme lighting conditions, SAM-YOLO similarly demonstrated optimal detection capabilities, especially in terms of robustness when dealing with complex lighting variations. These findings emphasize the potential of the SAM-YOLO algorithm for real-time and accurate target detection tasks, especially in environments with highly variable lighting conditions.</jats:p>"

            Recent advances in deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques for remote sensing images (RSIs) have shown significant promise. However, these performance improvements often come at a high computational cost, which limits their practical application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dual-branch SR model (DBSR) that enhances both model performance and efficiency through primary and auxiliary branches. The primary branch integrates the advantages of channel recalibration, a separable swin transformer (SST), and a spatial refinement module to achieve fine-grained feature extraction. The SST serves as the core of the primary branch, employing hierarchical window attention calculations to facilitate lightweight and effective multiscale feature representation. Conversely, the auxiliary branch enhances shallow features through a global information enhancement module, which mitigates the misleading effects of directly upsampling these shallow features on the SR results. Comparative and ablation experiments conducted on four RSI datasets and five SR benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DBSR method effectively balances the number of parameters with performance, showcasing its potential for application in RSI processing.

However, this domain continues to confront numerous challenges, especially due to the lack of precise temporal annotations. Consequently, this technique becomes highly susceptible to contextual background noise and overly reliant on prominent action segments, leading to less-than-ideal action localization. To alleviate this problem, we propose the contrastive learning-based action salience network (CLASNet), comprising two pivotal modules: feature contrast separation module (FCSM) and boundary refinement module (BRM). FCSM utilizes a contrastive learning approach to effectively separate action features from background features, thereby enhancing the discriminability of features. Concurrently, BRM introduces boundary refinement loss to rectify the temporal boundaries of actions, thereby further elevating the precision of temporal localization. The collaborative functioning of these two key modules effectively resolves the ambiguity issues in temporal action localization under weak supervision, markedly enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, CLASNet is versatile and can be integrated into different WTAL frameworks, achieving enhanced localization performance while preserving the original end-to-end training manner. Utilizing three large-scale benchmark action localization datasets, THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.2, and ActivityNet v1.3, we embed CLASNet into various cutting-edge weakly supervised temporal action localization methods, such as CO2-Net, DELU, and ACRNet, for empirical substantiation. The experimental outcomes reveal that CLASNet significantly enhances the efficacy of these methods in action localization, offering novel perspectives for the advancement of temporal action localization technology. </jats:p>"

            Triangle meshes are a crucial and powerful data type for three-dimensional (3D) shapes, extensively studied in the fields of computer vision and computer graphics. In this paper, we delve into the challenge of analyzing deforming 3D triangle meshes using deep neural networks. While existing methods extend graph-based deep learning to 3D triangle meshes using graph convolution, the lack of effective graph convolutional structures and pooling operations limits the learning capacity of their networks. We propose a variational autoencoder structure that integrates graph convolutional residual blocks with multilayer pooling to explore the latent space of 3D shapes for generation. This framework introduces graph convolutional residual blocks to address the issue of gradient vanishing in deep networks. By employing multilayer pooling and unpooling structures based on triangle mesh simplification, gradually reducing the spatial dimensions of the input, the model can extract more general features. This enables it to handle denser mesh models effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our generalized framework can learn reasonable representations of deformable shape collections with minimal training examples. It produces competitive results across various applications, including shape generation and interpolation, requiring fewer training samples and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Therefore, we need to raise attention and curiosity for AI and foster the willingness to engage with it among psychology students. This requires identifying approaches to integrate a general understanding of AI technology into formal psychological training and education. This study investigated to what extent psychology students currently accept and use AI and what affects their perception and usage. Therefore, an AI acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students. An acceptable fit with the data was found for an adapted version. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were most predictive for the students’ attitude towards AI; attitude itself, as well as perceived usefulness, social norm, and perceived knowledge, were predictors for the intention to use AI. In summary, we identified relevant factors for designing AI training approaches in psychology curricula. In this way, possible restraints regarding the use of AI can be reduced and its beneficial opportunities exploited in psychological contexts. </jats:p>"
sage,A Bateson-Inspired Model for the Generation of Semantic Concepts from Sensory Data,10.1177/30504554251314334,,Jaime de Miguel Rodríguez; Fernando Sancho Caparrini,The European Journal on Artificial Intelligence,2025,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/30504554251314334,"<jats:p>
            
            
            Although neural-symbolic techniques for symbol grounding in sensory data have shown significant effectiveness, they still require substantial training. This article revisits symbolic-only approaches by introducing a new algorithm for creating hierarchical concept structures from spatial sensory data. The method is based on Bateson’s idea of difference as the fundamental element of concept formation. By leveraging this principle, the algorithm extracts atomic features from raw data through basic sequential comparisons within a stream of multivariate numerical values. Experiments carried out on a set of common objects indicate that the method can successfully discriminate and assimilate categories as needed without training. The results show that the model improves on the neural networks it has been tested against, which required more than 400 training examples for the same task. The results also show that the model can generate rich conceptual structures and human-like representations, which (i) facilitate high composability, (ii) support formal reasoning, (iii) inherently enable generalisation, and (iv) possess potential for generative behaviour. Consequently, this approach offers a compelling contribution to symbol grounding and neural-symbolic research by providing a seamless algorithm to bridge perception and conceptual knowledge.

sage,Integrating Temporality and Causality into Acyclic Argumentation Frameworks Using a Transition System,10.1177/30504554251319451,,Yann Munro; Camilo Sarmiento; Isabelle Bloch; Gauvain Bourgne; Catherine Pelachaud; Marie-Jeanne Lesot,The European Journal on Artificial Intelligence,2025,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/30504554251319451,"<jats:p>
            
            
            In the context of abstract argumentation, we present the benefits of considering temporality, i.e. the order in which arguments are enunciated, as well as causality. We propose a formal method to rewrite the concepts of acyclic abstract argumentation frameworks into an action language that allows us to model the evolution of the world and to establish causal relationships between the enunciation of arguments and their consequences on the acceptability of other arguments, whether direct or indirect. An Answer Set Programming implementation is also described. Furthermore, we lay the ground for the generation of explanations using the causal relations as well as two graphical representations to support such explanations.

Although this may point to multiplicity of interpretations and backgrounds, a lack of conceptual clarity could thwart the development of common ground around the concept among researchers, practitioners and users of AI and pave the way for misinterpretation and abuse of the concept. This article argues that one of the effective ways to delineate the concept of AI is to compare and contrast it with human intelligence. In doing so, the article broaches the unique capabilities of humans and AI in relation to one another (human and machine tacit knowledge), as well as two types of AI systems: one that goes beyond human intelligence and one that is necessarily and inherently tied to it. It finally highlights how humans and AI can augment their capabilities and intelligence through synergistic human–AI interactions (i.e., human-augmented AI and augmented human intelligence), resulting in hybrid intelligence, and concludes with a future-looking research agenda. </jats:p>"

In this work, we address a famous combinatorial optimization problem on graphs, the graph coloring problem (GCP), and propose novel ways that train and utilize deep node embeddings to facilitate the problem’s solving. Specifically, we propose to use Transformer to learn the correlation between nodes in graphs. The Transformer learns the node embeddings (feature vectors) such that nodes that might be in the same color in (near-)optimal solutions have close embeddings. To generate the labels, we use a typical GCP heuristic called Tabucol to solve each small training instance multiple times. In this way, the labels are generated more efficiently and robustly as compared to using an exact solver. We then apply the learned embeddings to guide several construction and searching algorithms for the GCP, including Tabucol. Empirical results show that all the algorithms could be improved by utilizing the learned node embeddings, and our methods generalize well to graphs on much larger scales than the training graphs.</jats:p>"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) code-generation tools have outstanding capabilities in program generation and natural language understanding, creating conducive conditions for pairing with humans in programming. Now some more mature tools are gradually being implemented. This review summarizes the current status of educational applications and research on AI-assisted programming technology. Through thematic coding of literature, existing research focuses on five aspects: underlying technology and tool introduction, performance evaluation, the potential impacts and coping strategies, exploration of behavioral patterns in technological application, and ethical and safety issues. A systematic analysis of current literature provides the following insights for future academic research related to the practice of “human-machine pairing” in programming: (1) Affirming the value of AI code-generation tools while also clearly defining their technical limitations and ethical risks; (2) Developing adaptive teaching ecosystems and educational models, conducting comprehensive empirical research to explore the efficiency mechanisms of AI-human paired programming; (3) Further enriching the application of research methods by integrating speculative research with empirical research, combining traditional methods with emerging technologies.</jats:p>"

Additionally, a local feature aggregation module is utilized to learn the intensity features of small target point clouds through spatial intensity encoding. Furthermore, PointPillars technology is implemented to convert the three-dimensional point cloud into a pseudo-image, allowing for the extraction of features at various scales using a feature pyramid network. Experimental results demonstrate that MF-Net improves the mean average precision for pedestrian and cyclist detection by 2.49% and 2.88%, respectively, compared to the baseline network PointRCNN.

Nevertheless, as users may not recall all the details once finished, we propose an ethical conversational agent that respectfully conducts the survey during gameplay. To achieve this without hindering user’s engagement, we resort to reinforcement learning and an ethical embedding algorithm. Specifically, we transform the learning environment so that it guarantees that the agent learns to be respectful (i.e. aligned with the moral value of respect) while pursuing its individual objective of eliciting as much feedback information as possible. When applying this approach to a simple videogame, our comparative tests between the two agents (ethical and unethical) empirically demonstrate that endowing a survey-oriented conversational agent with this moral value of respect avoids disturbing user’s engagement while still pursuing its individual objective, which is to gather as much information as possible. </jats:p>"

            Paraphrasing involves rewording a text to maintain its meaning while using different language. In recent years, there has been growing interest among researchers in automatic paraphrase generation (APG). Previous studies have primarily focused on developing corpora and methods for APG tasks in English and other languages. However, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmark corpora and standardized methods specifically designed for APG in Urdu. To address this gap, this study introduces two extensive benchmark corpora: the Urdu Phrasal Paraphrase corpus (UPP-22 corpus) at the phrasal level and the Urdu Sentential Paraphrase corpus (USP-22 corpus) at the sentence level. The UPP-22 corpus contains 3,50,000 paraphrased pairs, while the USP-22 corpus consists of 11,000 paraphrased pairs, both specifically curated for the Urdu APG task. As a second major contribution, this research developed and applied various state-of-the-art deep learning models, including sequence-to-sequence models (using long short-term memory [LSTM], gated recurrent unit [GRU], bidirectional LSTM, and bidirectional GRU) and sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms as baseline methods for the proposed Urdu Paraphrase corpora. Additionally, the study introduced a bidirectional and auto-regressive transformer-based model specifically tailored to these corpora as a third contribution. A fourth significant contribution was the development of a test corpus at the phrasal level, consisting of 10,000 instances, created through automatic translation, followed by manual inspection and correction, to evaluate the performance of APG tasks for the Urdu language. As a fifth major contribution, the study applied and fine-tuned a large language model (GPT-4-Mini) for APG in Urdu, resulting in significant performance improvements. The evaluation was carried out using the standard bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) metric. The best results were achieved with BLEU-1 = 75.89 for the UPP-22 corpus and BLEU-1 = 75.16 for the USP-22 corpus using the GPT-4-Mini model, representing a significant improvement over all other models including baseline. These corpora and methodologies will be made publicly available to encourage and promote further research in APG for under-resourced languages such as Urdu.

We suggest allocation (ad placement) and pricing protocols which take into account preferences of both the publishers and the advertisers. The most promising protocol, the Weighted Bipartite Hungarian VCG protocol, collects the preferences of the auction’s participants and uses the Hungarian algorithm to maximize a weighted function of their preferences. Simulations show that this advantageous protocol can maintain a balanced budget over time while preserving most of the desired economic properties (e.g., individual rational, and truth telling), and reaches near optimal solutions. </jats:p>"

We consider a pool of service providers whose performance varies inversely with load. An agent's satisfaction with a service provider depends on a private function of the performance of the provider. An agent will ask for a referral from a centralized referral agency if its satisfaction from its current service provider is below its satisfaction threshold. Such an agent chooses one of the referred providers in the next time interval. The referral system reaches stability when all agents are satisfied with their current provider. We evaluate the relative merits of the following decisions by the centralized referral agency: number of service providers returned and the means for choosing those referrals. The performance metric used is the number of time periods to reach stable system configurations. Interesting observations include the advantage of performance proportionate and semi-deterministic schemes over deterministic referral decisions. </jats:p>

Tools have been implemented to support the re-configuration. Once new requirements are specified by business experts via the tools, the system automatically adapts its behaviour in the environment, without additional effort from developers. This novel approach pulls together a knowledgebase, configuration tools, and business experts as an integral environment through which the MAS achieves re-configurability ranging from overall infrastructure to individual policy sets. This fosters cost effective software evolution because much of the effort resulting from changes to business strategies and collaborations can be shifted from developers to customers, code change not being required since the environment maintains the dynamics instead. </jats:p>"

            scientific developments in the vehicle and infrastructure automation sectors are developing steadily to benefit end users in ways like reducing traffic congestion, enhancing safety, facilitating stress-free travel, reducing fuel costs, and enabling smart parking. Autonomous vehicles sometimes known as self-driving cars, can entirely replace conventional automobiles to accomplish safe and reliable intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Autonomous vehicles have improved sensing capabilities and can drive on roads that would be difficult for humans. Software, technology, and people, together with their interactions, are the building blocks of Autonomous vehicles. Even though Autonomous vehicles have been studied extensively, many issues have yet to be fixed. One of the biggest obstacles to developing Autonomous vehicles is improving their ability to communicate with other vehicles and pedestrians. Second, it's unclear whether society will benefit or suffer from people's tendency to place an excessive amount of faith in Autonomous vehicles and assume that they will never malfunction. Capabilities analysis is essential to making sure autonomous vehicles are safe and widely accepted. The proposed review outlines the key benefits, drawbacks, and difficulties of autonomous vehicle technology and provides a detailed analysis of the different autonomous vehicle mechanisms. Further, the developed review intends to formulate future prospects by examining the advantages and disadvantages of autonomous driving technology to encourage the development of innovative autonomous vehicle technologies to prevent human error and increase road safety and security.

            Vehicles (UAVs) made major advances in security and defence applications like information gathering, safety missions, monitoring, judicial systems, urban planning, disaster management, vehicle tracking, recreation, and farming assessment. Since they are controlled by intruders, hence the infiltrated UAVs performance is poor. Despite their numerous benefits, UAVs receive little attention in regards to security, exposing them to attack. The consequences of UAV hacking include the loss of top-secret details, and the loss of critical operations. The majority of intrusion risks are occurred due to the inadequate security in communication systems. Moreover, such communication presents security problems because of its dynamic topology. In this study, we analyse 50 research papers focusing on different secure communication systems in UAV strategies and their key problems. The research intention is carefully considered, because it is primarily concerned with the current problems via secure communication in UAVs. As a result, the analysis of numerous existing methods of secure communication in UAV, such as deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and so on is facilitated based on a number of measures, including the year of publication, performance metrics, outcome of the techniques in numerical evaluations, and other factors. In addition, the analysis of each method, and its merits and demerits are provided. The paper is concluded by discussing the possible future research instructions and difficulties realising in efficient secure communication in UAV.

            Crop production can be greatly affected by different diseases, which seriously threaten food security. Consequently, detecting plant diseases earlier and preventing the spread of plant diseases is necessary to avoid the economic imbalance. Nevertheless, the manual detection of plant diseases is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Numerous existing techniques are adopted that are unreliable in terms of accuracy and fail to identify the infected region due to non-uniform complex backgrounds resulting in mispredictions. Hence, this research presents a review that focuses on enhancing plant disease detection accuracy and early intervention. The comparison of various machine learning and deep learning techniques, data acquisition, segmentation methods, and feature extraction techniques are presented, particularly in disease prediction. The basic prediction approach encloses the classification model which is trained and the publicly available dataset or the collection of real-time data from the farms is tested. Those datasets include images of normal as well as plants with disease spots which serve as benchmarking datasets for the research. The paper recognizes challenges like limited data, scalability, and accuracy but seeks to leverage previous technologies to advance agricultural practices. Ultimately, the aim is to improve upon existing methodologies for more effective plant disease prediction, contributing to a more robust agricultural sector.

This problem occurs in many practical settings where facilities provide a service, such as the location of plants, bus-stops, fire stations, etc. Particularly, we deal with the continuous version of location problem where facilities have to be located in an Euclidean plane. This paper contributes to research on location problems by exploring a new approach based on reactive multiagent systems. The proposed model relies on a set of agents situated in a common environment which interact and attempt to reach a global optimization goal. The interactions between agents and their environment, which are based on the artificial potential fields approach, allow to locally optimize the agent's locations. The optimization of the whole system is the outcome of a process of agents self-organization. Then, we present how the model can be extended to the multi-level version of the location problem. Finally, the approach is evaluated to check its relevance. These evaluations concern both presented versions of the location problem. </jats:p>"

In this method, a two-sided multi-scale fusion network is used to realise the information exchange between shallow features and deep features, and to obtain contextual semantics. A new asymmetric convolution pyramid module is proposed, which fuses asymmetric convolution into cavity convolution layers with different expansion rates to improve feature extraction capability and reduce computation. A two-stage training method was used to train on a public data set and compared with other advanced lane detection methods. The experimental results show that the accuracy is 98.3% and the detection speed is 18.391 frames per second (fps), which is much better than other lane detection methods.

In addition, the fusion methods are too simple and do not take into account the different importance of various information sources on the final detection results. To address these limitations, we propose a named Dual-branch Hybrid Visual Networks and Hierarchical Adaptive Fusion Strategy Model (DVHAM). Specifically, we design a dual-branch hybrid network based on transformer and convolutional neural network architecture. This network not only considers the global features of the image but also fully incorporates the local details of the image. In addition, we incorporate the hierarchical information of text to construct a hierarchical adaptive dynamic fusion module. The module employs a paired multihead attention mechanism and an adaptive adjustment strategy based on a gating mechanism. This design enables the model to capture and utilize the complementarity and correlation between the semantic and visual information at different levels in the text model. Simultaneously, it adaptively fuses the modal interaction features containing different information for the final detection task. DVHAM achieves an accuracy of 91.5%, 92.4%, and 90.6% on the Weibo, TWITTER, and PHEME datasets, respectively. This proves the effectiveness of DVHAM in the field of fake news detection.</jats:p>"

Multi-agent systems can be used to model distributed systems of smart grids, such as smart grid operations, power system control, electricity market, and monitoring and diagnostic. Trust management can be considered a key component for successful interactions between autonomous agents in IoA, especially when agents cannot assure that potential interactions’ partners share the same core beliefs, or make accurate statements regarding their competencies and abilities. When interactions are based on trust, trust establishment mechanisms can be used to direct trustees, instead of trustors, to build a higher level of trust and have a greater impact on the results of interactions. This paper presents a trust establishment model that uses a multi-criteria (multidimensional) approach to help trustees in IoA environment to adjust their behaviors to improve their perceived trustworthiness, to attract more interactions with trustors. It calculates the necessary improvement per criterion when only a single aggregated satisfaction value is provided per interaction, where the model attempts to predicted both the appropriate value per criteria and its importance. The proposed model is evaluated through simulation, and results indicate that trustees empowered with the proposed model have higher levels of trust and better chances to be selected as interaction partners when such selection is based on trust. </jats:p>"

Bid prices submitted by users directly affect reliability of the instance acquired.

The strategy is firmly grounded on one-day-ahead spot price predictions using Random Forests. The bid price is not static but varies with job size to minimize cost and volatility of spot instances. We also develop a spot billing simulator to validate the bidding strategy against historical data. The simulator utilizes bid prices generated by PBS and Amazon’s real spot price traces of the bidding period for empirical investigations. We evaluate PBS for varying job sizes for a period of two weeks on different compute instance types and demonstrate that PBS greatly reduces job execution costs up to 80% while maintaining high reliability up to 80 to 90%. We compare PBS with several static bidding strategies and show that PBS provides spot instances with reliability for varying job sizes and greatly reduces risk of high execution costs. </jats:p>"

Reviews on e-commerce websites provided by the user provide valuable information about the product. Sentiment analysis on the text review helps to analyze the sentiment of users about the product and predict the sales of a product. The existing techniques in sentiment analysis use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that have limitations of vanishing gradient problem and overfitting problem. Initially, the Amazon review dataset is collected and processed in word embedding stage. The CNN is utilized to extract the features from the input dataset for sentiment analysis. The Word Embedding Attention (WEA) technique provides higher weight to the words having strong relation with class. The CNN feature helps to provide higher performance for a smaller number of training data. This technique helps to increase the performance of the model related class-wise, thus increasing the precision and recall value. Finally, WEA technique in Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) is used to increase the classification performance. The Balanced Cross-Entropy is proposed to maintain the gradient and solves the vanishing gradient problem in the network. The WEA-BiLSTM model has 97.4% accuracy, and 86.8% precision, and the existing CNN model has 97.1% accuracy and 85.4% precision in sentiment analysis. In this study, WEA-LSTM is used for the sentimental analysis of user reviews. This technique solves the vanishing gradient problem in the network by using Balanced Cross Entropy and helps to increase the performance of the model. </jats:p>"

            The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare marks a paradigmatic shift, raising not only technical and organizational challenges but also profound ethical questions. This theoretical-reflective paper explores the ethical dimensions of AI from a nursing perspective, focusing on the role of nurse leaders as ethical agents in the digital transformation of care. Drawing on philosophical and ethical frameworks, such as Heidegger’s notion of humans as “sensors of machines” and the concept of
            <jats:italic>algorethics</jats:italic>
            , the article argues that AI should not replace the relational, interpretive, and moral dimensions of care, but rather support them, provided its implementation is guided by ethical vigilance. The World Health Organization’s principles—autonomy, beneficence, transparency, accountability, justice, and sustainability—serve as the ethical foundation for AI in healthcare, highlighting the need to preserve human dignity and prevent discrimination. Yet algorithmic opacity, automation bias, and data-driven inequities demand renewed attention to responsibility, explainability, and the preservation of human agency. Nurse leaders are called to act along three ethical pillars: fostering transparency in algorithmic processes, ensuring shared responsibility for AI-supported decisions, and sustaining human relationships as the core of care. By reclaiming relational time (kairos) and resisting the delegation of moral judgment to machines, nurses safeguard the human face of care. In doing so, they embody a leadership rooted in presence, justice, and ethical discernment. Ultimately, this paper calls for a proactive governance of AI that anticipates its impacts and ensures its alignment with the telos of nursing: to care for persons with competence, conscience, and compassion.

However, it comes with dubious trustworthiness and is of high risk in exposing fake news. Hence, the automated discovery of fake news is an essential task. An innovative model is provided to identify fake news considering social media. Here, the BERT model is utilized to perform tokenization in order to produce tokens. Multiple features linked with the data are analyzed for detecting the behavior using the deep model. The features, like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), SentiWordNet scores, and sentence level features are obtained to automatically learn the features. Automatic discovery of fake news is done with Aquila Feedback Artificial tree-based Deep Residual Network (AFAT-based DRN). The optimum weight tuning of DRN is executed with AFAT and the AFAT is the fusion of Aquila optimizer (AO) and Feedback artificial tree (FAT). The impact detection of fake news is done with AFAT-based DRN, which helps to detect how many of them shared the fake news. The AFAT-based DRN offered high competence with utmost sensitivity of 92.3%, testing accuracy of 91.6%, and specificity of 91.9%. </jats:p>"

In this paper, we reflect on the role of the agent environment in multi-agent systems from a middleware perspective. Our study yields the following observations: (1) multi-agent system engineers consider distributed middleware (RMI, CORBA, etc.) as the basic platform for developing multi-agent systems, (2) common middleware services (security, persistency, etc.) are only minimally considered in multi-agent systems, (3) domain-specific middleware for multi-agent systems such as communication services and support for stigmergic coordination are typically developed as stand-alone services and as such difficult to compose with other services. </jats:p><jats:p> From these observations, we derive a number of challenges for research on environments in multi-agent systems: (1) to amplify reuse, application-specific services should be further consolidated into domain-specific services, (2) the problem of integration must be tackled, i.e. horizontal integration among domain-specific services for multi-agent systems, and vertical integration of domain-specific services upwards with the agents, and downwards with the common middleware services and the underlying distributed platform, (3) to support dynamic changing requirements of the system at hand, flexible composition and dynamic adaptation of services must be supported by the agent environment. </jats:p>"

To address the challenging need for coordination in such environments, and to provide the user a high-level of service quality, an engineered approach to exploit such information is required. Such an approach should generate added-value by offering means for combining diverse data sources, should allow delivering context-sensitive information and, hence, should promote context-dependent coordination of entities in ubiquitous environments. In this paper, we report the scenario-based analysis of key requirements for ubiquitous environments that we have used as the basis for the design of our proposal. Following, our proposal for the Ubiquitous Coordination Model (UbiCoMo) and its associated infrastructure is detailed. The UbiCoMo model covers an expressive data model based on four-field tuples to represent contextual information, data distribution and management concepts based on tuple spaces, and the integration of coordination patterns to resolve reoccurring coordination problems in ubiquitous scenarios. The UbiCoMo infrastructure integrates the fundamental mechanisms for agent-based coordination in ubiquitous environments, and is well-suited to provide the specific means required to offer high-level services and context-sensitive functionalities. A concrete ubiquitous application, the living diary, is assumed as a case study both to illustrate the requirements analysis and to exemplify the usage and the suitability of UbiCoMo. </jats:p>"

In this paper, we present an elaborated formal approach to model the core concepts of context-aware systems and their dynamic reconfigurations. The approach enables a high-level of abstraction and supports building context-aware systems by providing modularity and separation of concerns. For this purpose, one, we use Milner’s standard bigraphs to model the contextual part of the context-aware system and second, we provide an extension of the Bigraphical Reactive System (BRS) to model the functional part of multi-agent system architectures (BRS-MAS).

As there is a presence of multiple antennas at transmitter and receiver side, the proper Transmit Antenna Selection (TAS) for attaining effective performance is still a challenging point. This paper intends to introduce a TAS algorithm in LTE system using Self-Adaptive Grey Wolf Optimization (SAGWO) for improving the system performance. It introduces self-adaptiveness in the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) by determining the capacity improvement accomplished by each candidate solution for the TAS problem followed by updating the candidate solution based on the improvement. The simulation model considers both Rayleigh channel and Rician channel, for four antenna configurations like 2 [Formula: see text] 2, 3 [Formula: see text] 2, 4 [Formula: see text] 2 and 4 [Formula: see text] 4. To the next of the simulation, it compares the performance of SAGWO-TAS with EDB-TAS, ECB-TAS, ABC-TAS, GA-TAS, FF-TAS, PSO-TAS and GWO-TAS, i.e., traditional TAS models using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Ergodic Capacity (ECB), Euclidean Distance (EDB), Firefly (FF), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and GWO, respectively. It observes the BER (bit error ratio) and mean BER at varied SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) in the analysis section. The analysis proves that the BER is highly reduced for proposed optimal TAS model. </jats:p>"

However, we should be careful not to stare ourselves blind at the expectation that LLMs will necessarily always deliver superior ‘intelligence’. Rather, it may be more helpful to think of them as providing relatively cheap synthetic competent attention, considering that attention scarcity rather than information/knowledge scarcity is the critical bottleneck within many contexts of contemporary planning practice.

We used 10 clinically nuanced cases to test specific biases with and without a forewarning. Responses from the forewarning group were 50% longer and discussed cognitive biases more than 100 times more frequently compared with responses from the control group. Despite these differences, the forewarning decreased overall bias by only 6.9%, and no bias was extinguished completely.

However, such transformation has been so far elusive. The opacity of AI algorithms and the lack of quality annotated data being available at population scale are among the challenges to the application of AI in oncology. Fundamentally however, the heterogeneity of cancer and its evolutionary dynamics make every tumor response to therapy sufficiently different from the population, machine-learned statistical models, challenging hence the capacity of these models to yield reliable inferences about treatment recommendations that can improve patient outcomes. This article reviews the nominal elements of clinical decision-making for precision oncology and frames the utility of AI to cancer treatment improvements in light of cancer unique challenges. </jats:p>"

The performance of join operation is severely degraded in the presence of heavy skew in the datasets to be joined. Previous work mainly focuses on either input or output load imbalance among reducers, which is ineffective for load balancing. In this paper, we present a new data skew handling method based on Cluster Cost Partitioning (CCP) for optimizing parallel joins in MapReduce. A new cost model which considers the properties of both input and output is defined to estimate the cost of the parallel join. CCP employs clusters instead of join keys from input relations to create join matrix. Using the cost model, CCP identifies and splits heavy cells in the cluster join matrix. Then CCP assigns a set of non-heavy cells to reducers for join load-balancing. For different applications, the input and output weight values in the cost model could be dynamically adjusted to depict the join costs more precisely. The experimental results demonstrate that CCP achieves a more accurate load balancing result among reducers. </jats:p>"

Traditional methods of public policy evaluation often lack responsiveness and precision, hindering the ability of governments to achieve good governance. The introduction of a public satisfaction index into policy evaluations can drive governments to proactively address these challenges. This paper proposes a systematic and applicable online public opinion index system, utilizing artificial neural networks and big data, to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of public policy evaluations. Guided by the theory of three elements of attitude in social psychology, the index system captures the public’s attraction to specific policies, their stance, and emerging issues during policy promotion. By leveraging empirical data and a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), the model achieves a high accuracy of 93.40%, surpassing most comparable models. This approach offers a more scientific basis for improving government decision-making and policy performance. </jats:p>"

A significant issue in histogram estimation is the large amount of data transmission. This paper presents a distributed and parallel construction method for equi-width histogram in cloud database (called DPHCD). Unlike previous methods, the DPHCD does not require the transfer of any table detail during histogram construction. Only small information about buckets and a few necessary data need to be transmitted over the network. The data transmission of DPHCD is unrelated with table size. DPHCD divides the histogram task into small tasks that could be simultaneously executed in a distributed cluster. It uses an innovative tablet-level sampling method to reduce the computing overhead in each cluster node. DPHCD is implemented in the Xugu cloud database management system. Experimental results demonstrate that DPHCD can achieve small data transmission and speed up histogram construction. </jats:p>"

Unfortunately, the advantages of ABMs are achieved at the cost of significantly large execution times and high memory consumption for large-scale simulations. Addressing the memory issue, we designed and implemented an ABM using an innovative feature: the bitstring approach. In this approach, the attributes of the agents are represented by an array of bits instead of using traditional data structures. We describe the bitstring data representation and present a suitable logical formulation to map conceptual and compartmental models to a computer implementation by using spatio-temporal operators that represent the agents behavior and the disease propagation. Versions for CPU and GPU were implemented and presented good qualitative results and behavior similar to those obtained by traditional versions. The application of the bitstring technique proved to be relevant in economy of memory, allowing to store the same attributes using up to 80% less memory space. Besides, the use of the proposed approach also improved the data copy time between CPU-GPU in the GPU implementation, reducing the execution time up to 20%. </jats:p>"

            The emergence of the modern state was closely intertwined with the advent of statistics and demographic data. Today, we are witnessing the ascent of artificial intelligence as a new technology of governance. This article seeks to lay the groundwork for a research agenda at the intersection of the state and artificial intelligence, unpacking the notion of “AI” and examining the consequences of the state transitioning from statistics to artificial intelligence as the means of “seeing” its subjects. The first part of the article argues that artificial intelligence represents a fundamental epistemic shift: from
            <jats:italic>variables to patterns</jats:italic>
            , from

            <jats:italic>surveys to sensors</jats:italic>
            . This transition may transform governance and biopolitics, and with them, the very meanings of concepts such as citizenship, democracy, and population. In the second part of the article, the article draws on the literature on socio-technical transitions to conceptualize the integration of artificial intelligence into state practices, offering a framework to guide empirical research on how artificial intelligence is transforming governance.

The findings revealed that public academic libraries in South Africa did not have clear strategies for adopting AI innovations. Consequently, AI was not widely used. Library management systems can support AI, but some must be upgraded. Librarians had excellent computer literacy, although many had not received AI training to broaden their expertise and awareness of this innovation.

Each new step in the development and application of AI is accompanied by speculations about a supposedly imminent but largely fictional artificial general intelligence (AGI) with (super-)human capacities, as seen in the unfolding discourse about capabilities and impact of large language models (LLMs) in the wake of ChatGPT. These far-reaching expectations lead to a discussion on the societal and political impact of AI that is largely dominated by unfocused fears and enthusiasms. In contrast, this article provides a framework for a more focused and productive analysis and discussion of AI’s likely impact on one specific social field: democracy. First, it is necessary to be clear about the workings of AI. This means differentiating between what is at present a largely imaginary AGI and narrow artificial intelligence focused on solving specific tasks. This distinction allows for a critical discussion of how AI affects different aspects of democracy, including its effects on the conditions of self-rule and people’s opportunities to exercise it, equality, the institution of elections, and competition between democratic and autocratic systems of government. This article shows that the consequences of today’s AI are more specific for democracy than broad speculation about AGI capabilities implies. Focusing on these specific aspects will account for actual threats and opportunities and thus allow for better monitoring of AI’s impact on democracy in an interdisciplinary effort by computer and social scientists. </jats:p>"

Likewise, linguistic differences between instruments designed to measure analogous constructs might contribute to similar instruments possessing dissimilar psychometrics. This article introduces and demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence, to linguistically analyze 13 translations of two psychological measures previously translated into numerous languages. NLP was used to generate estimates reflecting specific linguistic characteristics of test items (emotional tone/intensity, sentiment, valence, arousal, and dominance), which were then compared across translations at both the test- and item-level, as well as between the two instruments. Results revealed that key linguistic characteristics can profoundly vary both within and between tests. Following a discussion of results, the current limitations of this approach are summarized and strategies for advancing this methodology are proposed.</jats:p>"

Thus, the intersection of both these areas is decision-making under uncertainty. Both these concepts put together have interesting implications for organisations. This article explores the impact of AI and Behavioural Economics on the human resources (HR) function of an organisation. Some of the contemporary applications of AI augmenting decision-making have been presented using the lens of the HR Value Chain. Based on these applications, implications for organisations are discussed. Despite limitations, AI, as a technology, is soon going to be embraced by the firms, leading to hybrid organisations.

The stratification associated with it has conformity emanating from the acceptance of the identity, which is not evading even after migrating to foreign countries to participate and be part of the capitalist mode of production. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a creation of the human mind. Caste is also a creation of the human mind. Technology has always paved the way for the betterment of society if used properly. Caste practices have always divided society and contaminated the public sphere with divisive manifestations of their stronghold in influencing social processes and policies.

It holds promise in addressing the leading cause of death in the United States and a significant driver of costs – cardiovascular disease (CVD). Traditional reimbursement models are slow to incorporate AI. This article explores alternative financial incentives for AI in CVD prevention in fee-for-service (FFS) and value-based care models across four domains – risk prediction, diagnostics, imaging, clinical decision support, and administrative strategies – where AI may provide indirect revenue generation, cost savings, and efficiency gains. Under FFS, AI can enhance revenue by driving appropriate healthcare utilization, improving billing accuracy, and streamlining administrative workflows. In value-based models, AI aligns with incentives to prevent disease progression, reduce hospitalizations, and optimize shared savings. While AI-powered tools offer a compelling financial value proposition in cardiovascular prevention, their real-world adoption and impact will depend on successful clinical validation and seamless integration into existing workflows. The future of AI in cardiovascular care depends on a shift in reimbursement models, regulatory adaptation, and continued evidence generation demonstrating cost-effectiveness and improved outcomes. As healthcare transitions toward value-based care, AI has the potential to be a catalyst for better prevention and long-term cost savings, but only if its business case is strategically developed and implemented.</jats:p>"

The rapid evolution of AI, especially generative AI and large language models (LLMs), have reignited the discussions about their potential impact on the healthcare industry, particularly regarding the role of healthcare providers. Concerning questions, “can AI replace doctors?” and “will doctors who are using AI replace those who are not using it?” have been echoed. To shed light on this debate, this article focuses on emphasizing the augmentative role of AI in healthcare, underlining that AI is aimed to complement, rather than replace, doctors and healthcare providers. The fundamental solution emerges with the human–AI collaboration, which combines the cognitive strengths of healthcare providers with the analytical capabilities of AI. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach ensures that the AI systems are guided, communicated, and supervised by human expertise, thereby maintaining safety and quality in healthcare services. Finally, the adoption can be forged further by the organizational process informed by the HITL approach to improve multidisciplinary teams in the loop. AI can create a paradigm shift in healthcare by complementing and enhancing the skills of healthcare providers, ultimately leading to improved service quality, patient outcomes, and a more efficient healthcare system. </jats:p>"

                <jats:p>
                  Artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice. This exploratory study evaluates ChatGPT's performance in diagnosing and classifying epileptic seizures, epilepsy, and underlying etiologies in adult patients compared to epileptologists and neurologists.
                  <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>
                  A prospective simulation study assessed 37 clinical vignettes based on real adult patient cases. ChatGPT was “trained” using official International League Against Epilepsy documents on epilepsy diagnosis and classification. Diagnoses and classifications by ChatGPT, two epileptologists, and two neurologists were compared against a reference standard set by a senior epileptologist. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Cohen's kappa (κ) was calculated to assess agreement.
                  <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>
                  ChatGPT demonstrated high sensitivity (≥96.9%) in identifying epileptic seizures and diagnosing epilepsy, ensuring no cases were missed. However, its specificity was lower, particularly for distinguishing acute symptomatic from unprovoked seizures (33.3%) and diagnosing epilepsy (26.7%), leading to frequent false positives. ChatGPT excelled in diagnosing epileptic syndromes (κ = 1.00) and structural etiologies (accuracy = 90.0%) but struggled with ambiguous cases such as unknown seizure onset (accuracy = 12.5%) and rare etiologies. Human experts consistently outperformed ChatGPT with near-perfect accuracy and higher κ values.
                  <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>
                  ChatGPT shows potential as a supplementary diagnostic tool but requires human oversight due to reduced specificity and limitations in nuanced clinical judgment. Further development with diverse datasets and targeted training is necessary to improve AI performance. Integrating AI with expert clinicians can optimize diagnostic workflows in epilepsy care.

According to the vertices and edges in the directed graph, the performer’s trajectory was determined, and the multi-resolution filtering algorithm in artificial intelligence technology was used to extract the motion path in the performer’s trajectory. The target path of stage performance arrangement was obtained by mapping the performer’s motion path through zoom processing. Based on the goal path, by arranging the control position of the performer’s root joint and correcting the direction of the performer, the movement track of the performer in the stage performance process was reconstructed, and the stage performance layout design was realized by combining with the position arrangement of the stage performance motion segment. The experimental results show that the method can accurately plan the performers’ path and improve the user’s satisfaction with the stage performance.</jats:p>"

The fast pace with which the multi-billion dollar AI industry advances toward the creation of human-level intelligence is accompanied by an increasingly exaggerated chorus of the ‘incredible miracle’, or the ‘incredible horror’, intelligent machines will constitute for humanity, as the human is gradually replaced by a technologically superior proxy, destined to be configured as a functional (data) component at best, a relic at worst. More than half a century ago, Günther Anders sketched out this path toward technological obsolescence, and his work on ‘Promethean shame’ and ‘Promethean discrepancy’ provides an invaluable means with which to recognise and understand the relationship of the modern human to his/her technological products. In this article, I draw on Anders’s writings to unpack and unsettle contemporary narratives of our relation to AI, with a view toward refocusing attention on the responsibilities we bear in producing such immersive technologies. With Anders, I suggest that we must exercise and develop moral imagination so that the human capacity for moral responsibility does not atrophy in our technologically mediated future. </jats:p>"

            This article offers a theological account of creativity in light of recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models. Drawing on scripture and the philosophical work of Margaret Boden, it argues that creativity—whether divine, human, or computational—is best understood as a moral category. After introducing theologically appropriate forms of analogy, the essay distinguishes between two kinds of divine creativity: creativity
            <jats:italic>ex nihilo</jats:italic>
            (creating from nothing) and creativity
            <jats:italic>in imago</jats:italic>
            (creating in the image of God). These serve as interpretive lenses for assessing human and computational creativity. While AI systems like ChatGPT can produce outputs that are novel, surprising, and valuable, they cannot create
            <jats:italic>ex nihilo</jats:italic>
            or bear the divine image. Their creativity is real but limited, acquiring moral significance only when guided by human agents acting
            <jats:italic>in imago</jats:italic>
            . The final section explores how morally responsible creativity involves accountability, self-formation, and questioning—traits exemplified (in varying degrees of success) in scripture by figures such as Adam, Eve, and Mary, the mother of Jesus. The article concludes that divine creativity is not only the origin but also the ethical standard by which all creativity, including our engagement with AI, should be measured.

Implementation science deals with the designing of methods and strategies for increasing and facilitating the uptake of evidence into practice and policymaking. Nevertheless, the process of designing and selecting methods and strategies for implementing evidence is complicated because of the complexity of health-care settings where implementation is desired. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized a range of fields, including genomics, education, drug trials, research, and health care. This commentary discusses how AI can be leveraged to expedite implementation science efforts for transforming health-care practice. Four key aspects of AI use in implementation science are highlighted: (a) AI for implementation planning (e.g., needs assessment, predictive analytics, and data management), (b) AI for developing implementation tools and guidelines, (c) AI for designing and applying implementation strategies, and (d) AI for monitoring and evaluating implementation outcomes. Use of AI along the implementation continuum from planning to delivery and evaluation can enable more precise and accurate implementation of evidence into practice. </jats:p>"

Every trimester comes with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. The second trimester is said to be the most pleasant one. Nevertheless, it comes with anxiety and stress. To eliminate these emotions, doctors perform a second trimester ultrasound. This is also called the second trimester morphology scan. This type of scan is important because it determines if the fetus is growing and developing at normal pace. The sonographer measures the baby’s size and weight, the fetal heart, brain, spine, skeleton, abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic organs. She/he also checks whether there are hard or soft genetic disorders markers, whether the amniotic fluid levels are normal or not, and determine the location of the placenta. All these verifications and estimations imply a good experience in fetal ultrasonography. Unfortunately, experienced sonographers are clustered in big city cities, and cannot be found in poor regions. In order for everybody to have access to premium fetal morphology ultrasounds, there is a need for artificial intelligence methods. Artificial Intelligence algorithms can signal possible anomalies, which an unexperienced sonographer might miss.

Specifically, the history of the ideational manufacturing of human intelligence demonstrates a pattern of interest in calculation and computation, intelligent human and machinic behaviours that are, not surprisingly, ideologically aligned with capitalism. The simultaneous series of machinic and technological invention and related experiments shows how machines not only facilitate the processes of normalisation of what is considered intelligent behaviours, via both human and machinic intelligence, but also facilitate and enable the integration of capitalism into everyday work and life. Intelligent behaviours are identified as the capacity for quantification and measure and are limited to aspects of thinking and reasoning that can provide solutions to, for example, obstacles in the production and extraction of surplus value, based on the specific postulations and assumptions highlighted in this piece. Today, ideas of autonomous machinic intelligence, seen in the ways artificial intelligence is incorporated into workplaces outlined in the sections below, facilitate workplace relations via intelligent behaviours that are assistive, prescriptive, descriptive, collaborative, predictive and affective. The question is, given these now autonomous forms of intelligence attributed to machines, who/what is looking in the mirror at whose/which reflection? </jats:p>"

            This paper examines ambiguity within AI practice, arguing for an ethics of AI which stays with fundamental ambiguities and accounts for their complex socio-material entanglements. However, common approaches to responsible governance of AI are often predicated upon notions of predictable pipelines and static outputs which are assumed to be easily describable and cleanly structured. Drawing upon empirical findings which challenge these notions, and conceptual tools from Simone de Beauvoir's
            <jats:italic>Ethics of Ambiguity</jats:italic>
            , I illustrate how AI [ethics] can be better understood as grounded in ambiguity and propose reframing ambiguity from a failure or risk to a core facet of the study and governance of AI. I report on interviews with 23 AI practitioners, combined with observations from an ethnography of an AI practitioner based in an industry AI lab, examining their motivations, aims and actions in developing and implementing AI models. Practitioners described the impact of local, epistemic and systemic constraints, employing heuristics, intuition and creative problem-solving to navigate embedded, inherent ambiguity and uncertainty across material and practice. Building on these analyses, I propose that engaging with ambiguity in the study and ethics of AI can provide productive sites for ethical reflection and governance.

Human catalogers inevitably introduce personal and cultural biases into their work, but artificial intelligence may perpetrate biases on a previously unseen scale. The automation of this process may be perceived as a greater threat than the manipulation produced by human operators.

Often it seems to refer to the mechanisms and structures needed to avoid “bad” outcomes and achieve “good” outcomes with regard to the ethical problems artificial intelligence is thought to actualize. In this article we argue that, although this outcome-focused view captures one important aspect of “good governance,” its emphasis on effects runs the risk of overlooking important procedural aspects of good AI governance. One of the most important properties of good AI governance is political legitimacy. Starting out from the assumptions that AI governance should be seen as global in scope and that political legitimacy requires at least a democratic minimum, this article has a twofold aim: to develop a theoretical framework for theorizing the political legitimacy of global AI governance, and to demonstrate how it can be used as a compass for critially assessing the legitimacy of actual instances of global AI governance. Elaborating on a distinction between “governance by AI” and “governance of AI” in relation to different kinds of authority and different kinds of decision-making leads us to the conclusions that much of the existing global AI governance lacks important properties necessary for political legitimacy, and that political legitimacy would be negatively impacted if we handed over certain forms of decision-making to artificial intelligence systems. </jats:p>"

We test these claims by fielding a survey experiment among a representative sample of cadets assigned to the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program in the United States. Our analysis reveals that cadets are more trusting of AI-enhanced military technologies than senior officers, but that their trust is shaped by a more conservative understanding of the appropriate use and oversight of AI. We also find that cadets’ trust is shaped by a complex set of instrumental, normative, and operational considerations, including ongoing cognitive development, education, and professional enculturation. These results provide the first experimental evidence of cadets’ trust in AI-enhanced military technologies and have implications for future research, policy, and military modernization. </jats:p>"

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental goal of this research is to investigate the quantitative relationship between technology-oriented knowledge management, innovation, e-governance, and smart city performance using knowledge management-based service science theory and diffusion of innovation theory. Previous research has found a connection between knowledge management, innovation, e-governance, and e-service delivery. We believe that these are not only direct connections but also contextual and interactive relationships, so we explored the significance of innovation as a mediator between knowledge management and e-service delivery. Furthermore, we investigated the moderating impact of e-governance on the relationship between innovation and e-service delivery. Using SPSS to analyze data from 569 participants in South Korea, Pakistan, Japan, and Bangladesh, we discovered that these direct relationships are contextual in the sense that innovation mediates the relationship between knowledge management and e-service delivery and e-governance moderates the correlation between innovation and e-service delivery. Based on the outcomes from quantitative analysis, all our proposed hypotheses in this study were supported significantly.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

            <jats:title>Objectives</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Carotid stenosis plays a significant role in stroke burden. Surgical intervention in the form of carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting is an important stroke risk reduction strategy. Careful patient selection with identification of high-risk individuals is crucial to operative planning given perioperative risks including stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) consisting of mathematical algorithms that can learn from datasets to perform particular tasks. These algorithms offer a tool for prediction of patient outcomes by analysis of preoperative data leading to improved patient selection. This systematic review aims to assess the use of artificial intelligence in risk stratification for carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>After duplicate processing, a total of 100 articles underwent title and abstract screening resulting in 11 clinical studies published between 2008 and 2023 that fit eligibility criteria. Surgical outcomes assessed included haemodynamic instability, shunt requirement, hyperperfusion syndrome, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. Artificial intelligence models were able to accurately predict major adverse cardiovascular events (AUC 0.84), postoperative haemodynamic instability (AUC 0.86), shunt requirement (AUC 0.87), and postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome (AUC 0.95). However, many studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of external validation.</jats:p>

Artificial intelligence language models have the potential to generate lay abstracts that are consistent and accurate while reducing the potential for misinterpretation or bias. This study presents examples of artificial intelligence-generated lay abstracts of recently published articles, which were produced using different currently available artificial intelligence tools. The generated abstracts were of high linguistic quality and accurately represented the findings of the original articles. Adopting lay summaries can increase the visibility, impact, and transparency of scientific research, and enhance scientists’ reputation among peers, while currently, available artificial intelligence models offer solutions to produce lay abstracts. However, the coherence and accuracy of artificial intelligence language models must be validated before they can be used for this purpose without restrictions. </jats:p>"

Across multiple studies (total N = 1,668), we showed that these construal-based differences affect compliance with persuasive messages made by artificial agents. These messages are more appropriate and effective when the message represents low-level as opposed to high-level construal features.

            This article proposes an alternative analysis for the relationship between the sign maker and the sign in Multimodal Social Semiotics (MSS). A revised framework is required to ensure that MSS remains relevant in sociotechnical contexts where AI systems can create multimodal ensembles autonomously. When an automated intelligent system outputs a multimodal sign, no human sign maker’s intentionality and agency are
            <jats:italic>directly</jats:italic>
            involved in the process, and therefore the sign cannot be described as ‘motivated’. This raises significant conceptual problems for canonical MSS. However, this article argues that signs can still be classified as motivated even when they are created by autonomous AI systems. To accomplish this, though, it is first necessary to restructure the hierarchy that exists between the sign maker and the sign. In the reworked framework developed here, the intentionality and agency of the sign designer(s) shape and motivate the specification of the sign
            <jats:italic>design</jats:italic>
            , and this design is then realised by the sign makers (whether humans or autonomous intelligent systems) that create the sign. This modified hierarchy enables MSS-based analyses to incorporate automated intelligent systems as sign makers without destabilising core theoretical underpinnings of the theory.

These missing birds not only represent consequences for biodiversity loss but also “naturalize” assumptions about sex and sexuality for all species, including humans. In this article, we interrogate avian datafication practices and introduce Salvaging Birds, a multimodal project proposing “queer data surrogacy” as a method for generating “queer ecological data,” that is data resisting normative environmental frameworks.

Lately, deep learning techniques have radically enriched the ability of computers to identify objects in images fostering the prospect for fully automated computer-aided diagnosis. Given the noticeable role of nuclear structure in cancer detection, AI’s pattern recognizing ability can expedite the diagnostic process. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we propose and implement an image classification technique to identify breast cancer. METHODS: We implement the convolutional neural network (CNN) on breast cancer image data set to identify invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). RESULT: The proposed CNN model after data augmentation yielded 78.4% classification accuracy. 16% of IDC (-) were predicted incorrectly (false negative) whereas 25% of IDC (+) were predicted incorrectly (false positive). CONCLUSION: The results achieved by the proposed approach have shown that it is feasible to employ a convolutional neural network particularly for breast cancer classification tasks. However, a common problem in any artificial intelligence algorithm is its dependence on the data set. Therefore, the performance of the proposed model might not be generalized.</jats:p>"

Current presumptions about the distinction between human behaviour and artificial intelligence are identified through a survey of discussions about AI and `expert systems'. These discussions exhibit a restricted view of sociological competence, a marked rhetoric of progress and a wide variation in assessments of the state of the art. By drawing upon recent themes in the social study of science, these discussions are shown to depend on certain key dichotomies and on an interpretive flexibility associated with the notions of intelligence and expertise. The range of possible associations between sociology and AI reflects the extent to which we are willing to adopt these features of AI discourse. It is suggested that one of the more important options is to view the AI phenomenon as an occasion for reassessing the central axiom of sociology that there is something distinctively `social' about human behaviour. </jats:p>"

Drawing on an ethnographic case study within a film cooperative, it identifies four modalities through which social scientists become enrolled in AI-related organizational processes: as middlemen linking theory and practice, as distributors facilitating the flow of agency, as coordinators bridging innovation and appropriation, and as hosts observing the reproduction of technical skills. Situated at the intersection of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Media Studies, the article rethinks mediation not as passive translation, but as an active montage of fragmented meanings, practices, and actors. It argues that AI is not merely an object of study but a distributed assemblage whose significance emerges through situated associations. By articulating how social scientists engage with AI through organizational consultation, cultural programming, and collaborative experimentation, this paper reframes the sociology of AI as a field of strategic, reflexive, and creative intervention. In doing so, it highlights the importance of problematizing mediation as a relational practice that connects cultural actors, technologies, and institutions in the evolving ordering of artificial intelligence.</jats:p>"

Growing evidence suggests that it fails to identify a substantial proportion of ACO cases, leading to delays in intervention and missed treatment opportunities. The occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) paradigm has emerged as a more inclusive diagnostic framework, emphasising the recognition of ACO regardless of ST-segment elevation. While OMI offers a more accurate classification, its adoption in OOH settings presents challenges, particularly due to the complexity of ECG interpretation and variability in clinician expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address these limitations by providing real-time ECG analysis, improving diagnostic accuracy, and reducing inter-rater variability. AI-driven models, particularly artificial neural networks, have demonstrated superior sensitivity in detecting ACO compared to clinician interpretation using the traditional STEMI criteria, with the ability to identify occlusion earlier and more consistently. Additionally, AI integration with telemedicine could facilitate remote expert consultation, ensuring timely decision-making, particularly in resource-limited settings. By enhancing diagnostic accuracy and enabling earlier intervention, AI has the potential to improve prehospital cardiac care, and ultimately, patient outcomes. Future research should focus on optimising AI models, integrating them into OOH workflows, and validating their real-world effectiveness in acute coronary syndrome management.</jats:p>"

To engage in this complex decision-making, clinicians must first risk stratify pulmonary nodules to determine what the best course of action should be. Recent developments in imaging technology, computer processing power, and artificial intelligence algorithms have yielded radiomics-based computer-aided diagnosis tools that use CT imaging data including features invisible to the naked human eye to predict pulmonary nodule malignancy risk and are designed to be used as a supplement to routine clinical risk assessment. These tools vary widely in their algorithm construction, internal and external validation populations, intended-use populations, and commercial availability. While several clinical validation studies have been published, robust clinical utility and clinical effectiveness data are not yet currently available.

The essay first explores the distinct state-capital nexus in China’s AI development, characterized by paradoxical modes of operation driven by neoliberal motivations, yet also deeply influenced by symbolic lexicons, value systems, and institutional structures rooted in Leninist-Maoist traditions. The complex interplay of state support, local governmental practices, and market investment showcases ongoing negotiations among contradictory political-economic objectives and subject positions that resist simplification into a globally universalized model of neoliberal capitalism.

We question if this is ‘fair, just and reasonable’ to clinical users: we argue that a duty of care to patients ought to be recognised on the part of SDCs as well as clinicians. As an alternative to negligence claims, we propose ‘risk pooling’ which utilises insurance. Here, a fairer construct of shared responsibility for AIS use could be created between the clinician and the SDC; thus, allowing a rapid mechanism of compensation to injured patients via insurance. </jats:p>"

Iterative polynomial fitting is one of the most popular methods for baseline correction of these spectra. However, the baseline estimated by iterative polynomial fitting may have a substantial error when the spectrum contains significantly strong peaks or have strong peaks located at the endpoints. First, iterative polynomial fitting uses temporary baseline estimated from the current spectrum to identify peak data points. If the current spectrum contains strong peaks, then the temporary baseline substantially deviates from the true baseline. Some good baseline data points of the spectrum might be mistakenly identified as peak data points and are artificially re-assigned with a low value. Second, if a strong peak is located at the endpoint of the spectrum, then the endpoint region of the estimated baseline might have a significant error due to overfitting. This study proposes a search algorithm-based baseline correction method (SA) that aims to compress sample the raw spectrum to a dataset with small number of data points and then convert the peak removal process into solving a search problem in artificial intelligence to minimize an objective function by deleting peak data points. First, the raw spectrum is smoothened out by the moving average method to reduce noise and then divided into dozens of unequally spaced sections on the basis of Chebyshev nodes. Finally, the minimal points of each section are collected to form a dataset for peak removal through search algorithm. SA selects the mean absolute error as the objective function because of its sensitivity to overfitting and rapid calculation. The baseline correction performance of SA is compared with those of three baseline correction methods, the Lieber and Mahadevan-Jansen method, adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares method, and improved asymmetric least squares method. Simulated and real Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectra with polynomial-like baselines are employed in the experiments. Results show that for these spectra the baseline estimated by SA has fewer error than those by the three other methods. </jats:p>"

The rates of perinatal health indicators such as maternal mortality and morbidity; fetal, neonatal, and infant mortality; low birthweight; and preterm birth have reduced over time. However, they are still a public health concern, and considerable disparities exist within and between countries. For perinatal researchers who are engaged in unraveling the tangled web of causation for maternal and child health outcomes and for clinicians involved in the care of pregnant women and infants, artificial intelligence offers novel approaches to prediction modeling, diagnosis, early detection, and monitoring in perinatal health. Machine learning, a commonly used artificial intelligence method, has been used to predict preterm birth, birthweight, preeclampsia, mortality, hypertensive disorders, and postpartum depression. Real-time electronic health recording and predictive modeling using artificial intelligence have found early success in fetal monitoring and monitoring of women with gestational diabetes especially in low-resource settings. Artificial intelligence–based methodologies have the potential to improve prenatal diagnosis of birth defects and outcomes in assisted reproductive technology too. In this scenario, we envision artificial intelligence for perinatal research to be based on three goals: (1) availability of population-representative, routine clinical data (rich multimodal data of large sample size) for perinatal research; (2) modification and application of current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for prediction and classification in health care research to the field of perinatal health; and (3) development of methods for explaining the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence models for perinatal health indicators. Achieving these three goals via a multidisciplinary approach to the development of artificial intelligence tools will enable trust in these tools and advance research, clinical practice, and policies to ensure optimal perinatal health. </jats:p>"

We identify five analytical categories to help us understand the different and often contested perspectives on AI4D. They are (a) a developmentalist framework that emphasizes discourses around modernity and progress through a technoliberal lens of ‘catching up’; (b) an economic development framework taken up by African states, private sector and civil society, highlighting a positive and more future-looking outlook on AI's potential for development; (c) an international policy framework tied to globally agreed on policies such as the Sustainable Development Goals; (d) a colonial and extractivist framework that articulates how AI4D reinforces old processes of oppression in new ways; and (e) decolonial AI discourses grounded in Latin American, African and Indigenous approaches. Our critical review of literature on AI4D and related expressions shows that while the notion applies broadly to the global South, the majority of publications use the term in reference to AI development on the African continent. This commentary enriches our understanding of the plurality of meanings, where they come from, what they do, and what they leave unaddressed.</jats:p>"

Culture is modeled as comprising a system of transindividual Piagetian schemata guiding social action. Such a schema is reinforced when the action it mandates in some social setting yields the reactions from other people guided by their own schemata that fit its goal and expectations. An enduring social structure is a pattern of action that reproduces itself by stimulating and reinforcing the schemata animating its actions. These concepts are operationalized by a program written in PROLOG. The program takes as a knowledge base a representation of the preferences and judgments of social causality of subjects in some historical situation. It assembles schemata from this knowledge base that are stimulated by past actions of other subjects, and that then monitor the flow of action to see if the desired reactions to their action are forthcoming. The model is illustrated by simulating Skocpol's analysis of China's sociopolitical structure in the 1930s and O'Donnell's analysis of the Latin American bureaucratic-authoritarian structure of the 1960s. </jats:p>"

Real-world examples of organizations who are using AI in digital marketing abound. For example, Red Balloon and Harley Davidson used AI to automate their digital advertising campaigns. However, we are early in the process of both the practical application of AI by firms broadly and by their marketing functions in particular. One could argue that we are even earlier in the research process of conceptualizing, theorizing, and researching the use and impact of AI. Importantly, as with most technologies of significant potential, the application of AI in marketing engenders not just practical considerations but ethical questions as well. The ability of AI to automate activities, that in the past people did, also raises the issue of whether marketing professionals will embrace AI as a means to free them from more mundane tasks to spend time on higher value activities, or will they view AI as a threat to their employment? Given the nascent nature of research on AI at this point, the full capabilities and limitations of AI in marketing are unknown.

We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment. </jats:p>"

A deep understanding and clarification of these concepts are fundamental and a prerequisite for developing robust frameworks and practical guidelines to ensure the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of DH solutions and AI-embedded technologies. Categorizing DH into technologies (DHTs) and services (DHSs) enables regulatory, HTA, and reimbursement bodies to develop category-specific frameworks and guidelines for evaluating these solutions effectively. DH is the key in generating real-world data, which is increasingly important in decision-making processes. The potential benefits of DHTs in improving health outcomes and reducing health system costs can position them alongside traditional health technologies in certain medical conditions. AI, one of the potential tools for DH, can be embedded in technologies, such as medical devices or applications, to enhance functionality and performance. AI excels at handling numerical and perceptual data. In the context of numerical data, machine learning algorithms enable prediction, classification, and clustering. In managing perceptual data, AI recognizes image/video, voice, and text.

This communicative approach often centers around personality, the rationale being that individuals resonate with messages differently depending on their personality type. There has been research into whether machine learning methods can improve the detection of personality types, but insufficient analysis has focused on whether large language models enhance this technique even further. And so, this study examines the ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, two of the models underpinning OpenAI's ChatGPT, to classify personality type. Using a publicly available dataset collected through the ‘PersonalityCafe’ forum, this paper found that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were able to perfectly classify 73% and 76% of the sample's personality type, respectively, simply by analyzing an individual's 50 most recent tweets—a level which is significantly better than random guessing and other machine learning models. This has important implications for communication scholarship because if LLMs enable actors to detect personality types more accurately, micro-targeting could become even more powerful and widespread. There is also a possibility for misuse by bad actors and privacy threats, so understanding these mechanisms is crucial for building safe artificial intelligence systems and safeguards against this. </jats:p>"

            <jats:p>AI psychotherapy represents relatively unchartered territory. There are concerns surrounding the trainability of AI chatbots, as well as the ultimate ability for an AI to effectively deliver human-like care. We must also consider other consequences, such as the potential for technological misuse. Thus, as AI continues to evolve, we must approach its integration with caution, and ensure the necessary regulatory mechanisms are in place for its effective and equitable implementation.</jats:p>

The idea at the core of such theories could be described as ‘cognition is computing’; that is, that human psychological and symbolic representations and the operations involved in structuring such representations in human thinking and intelligence can be converted by AI into a series of cognitive symbolic representations and calculations in a manner that simulates human intelligence. However, after decades of development, the cognitive computing doctrine has encountered many difficulties, both in theory and in practice; in particular, it is far from approaching real human intelligence. Real human intelligence runs through the whole process of the emotions. The core and motivation of rational thinking are derived from the emotions. Intelligence without emotion neither exists nor is meaningful. For example, the idea of ‘hot thinking’ proposed by Paul Thagard, a philosopher of cognitive science, discusses the mechanism of the emotions in human cognition and the thinking process. Through an analysis from the perspectives of cognitive neurology, cognitive psychology and social anthropology, this article notes that there may be a type of thinking that could be called ‘emotional thinking’. This type of thinking includes complex emotional factors during the cognitive processes. The term is used to refer to the capacity to process information and use emotions to integrate information in order to arrive at the right decisions and reactions. This type of thinking can be divided into two types according to the role of cognition: positive and negative emotional thinking. That division reflects opposite forces in the cognitive process. In the future, ‘emotional computing’ will cause an important acceleration in the development of AI consciousness. The foundation of AI consciousness is emotional computing based on the simulation of emotional thinking. </jats:p>"

This article investigates the meaning-making of AI in the case of AlphaGo by employing and refining cultural sociological narrative analysis. Building on Smith’s structural model of genre, whose horizontal axis reflects varying degrees of (dis-)enchantment, I propose an extended model of narrative genre, adding a vertical axis on the theoretical basis of Durkheim’s distinction between pure and impure sacred, to account for the empirical bifurcation between utopian and dystopian AI narratives. While critical approaches to AI, prevalent in sociology, tend to offer disenchanted narratives, my cultural sociological approach allows for the construction of a meta-narrative, which is able to capture not only enchantment as well as disenchantment but also purification and impurification as empirical processes that accompany the emergence and consolidation of new technologies. This approach is exemplified by a case study of AlphaGo, a Go-playing program utilizing machine learning and neural networks, which gained global prominence and cultural significance after beating a human grandmaster in 2016. Drawing on publicly available online data, this article investigates the discourses surrounding AlphaGo, focusing on its cultural construction through storytelling and genre. I not only show how characters and events were emplotted in different stories, which were in turn embedded in broader narratives about technological progress and AI, but also explain how the development of the main storyline was driven by in-game performances, audience expectations and collective representations. The article demonstrates the feasibility of a cultural sociology of AI and the usefulness of my extended model of narrative genre, which is not only applicable to AI discourses but other domains as well. </jats:p>"

Bolstered by increased baseline funding, the number of Norwegians without a designated GP has been nearly halved. Predicating this improvement is the fact that GP patient lists are gradually becoming shorter. For the first time, the average GP list now includes fewer than 1000 individuals. To maintain this positive development, either more physicians must choose to become GPs—which would likely come at significant cost to municipalities and the state—or solutions must be implemented that allow for sustainable patient list sizes while mitigating the chronic overload that many GPs have faced. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models may offer promising capabilities in this setting. In this commentary, we explore how AI, wearable devices, everyday technologies, social chatbots, and “health companions” could help alleviate the burden on the GP scheme, empower individuals in managing their own health, and reduce overall societal healthcare costs.</jats:p>"

It addresses the question: what, if anything, makes human rights well suited to face the challenges arising from new and emerging technologies like AI? It argues that the historical evolution of human rights as a series of legal norms and concrete practices has made it well placed to address AI-related challenges. The human rights framework should be understood comprehensively as a combination of legal remedies, moral justification, and political analysis that inform one another. Over time, the framework has evolved in ways that accommodate the balancing of contending rights claims, using multiple ex ante and ex post facto mechanisms, involving government and/or business actors, and in situations of diffuse responsibility that may or may not result from malicious intent. However, the widespread adoption of AI technologies pushes the moral, sociological, and political boundaries of the human rights framework in other ways. AI reproduces long-term, structural problems going beyond issue-by-issue regulation, is embedded within economic structures that produce cumulative negative effects, and introduces additional challenges that require a discussion about the relationship between human rights and science &amp; technology. Some of the reasons for why AI produces problematic outcomes are deep rooted in technical intricacies that human rights practitioners should be more willing than before to get involved in. </jats:p>"

Based on the constructivist teaching theory, with the help of the 4 C/ID model idea, combined with the characteristics and functions of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, and traditional teaching activities are organically combined to design a teaching design model of artificial intelligence assisted English teaching. It designed an integrated management system for English teaching resource information based on artificial intelligence. The hardware design of the system is realized relying on the design of the English teaching resource storage module and system server design. Based on the design of the system operating environment and database design, the software design of the system is realized. The results show that the proposed integrating management system of English teaching resource information is more suitable for sharing English teaching resource information than the conventional integrated management system of English teaching resource information.

The purpose of the construction of teaching resources database is to make the teaching resources can be systematically and scientifically planned, stored in the computer in the form of data, and can be directly extracted from the computer when necessary, so as to realize the efficient utilization of resources. Based on the existing problems of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, this paper puts forward some suggestions on the construction of teaching resource database. In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence technology provides a new idea for the establishment of teaching resource database. According to the basic idea of artificial intelligence, scientists have established a new database of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, updated and improved the original database, and established a new standard for teaching database according to the characteristics of artificial intelligence technology. A teaching resource database system based on teaching resources and artificial intelligence is established. The system is divided into data layer, logic layer and presentation layer.

Specifically, the study investigates both the direct effect of AI on energy vulnerability and its spatial threshold effect via government effectiveness, utilizing panel data from 67 countries. The results show that AI significantly lowers global energy vulnerability and indirectly alleviates it by improving government effectiveness. The panel threshold model analysis uncovers that AI's mitigating effects are particularly pronounced in countries with lower levels of government effectiveness. Additionally, AI demonstrates significant spatial spillover effects, helping reduce energy vulnerability in both domestic and neighboring countries through technological diffusion and cooperation. The spatial threshold model further suggests that as government effectiveness improves, AI's impact on energy vulnerability in both domestic and neighboring countries diminishes. These findings are critical for advancing our understanding of AI's role in global energy policy, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the complexities and spatial effects of AI when designing effective energy security policies.</jats:p>"

Specifically, Disability Studies scholars have used qualitative research to understand more about disabled peoples’ experiences. Like other marginalized identities, disability is often misunderstood pejoratively. We offer concerns about whether LLMs can address key qualitative analysis markers, contextualizing these concerns within disability research. To test these concerns, we assigned two LLMs, ChatGPT and Gemini, coding tasks using existing secondary de-identified data. We found LLMs were not able to produce codes that were high quality, credible, or consistent, and could not parse data from research participants with certain disabilities.

Ethnographic observations, interviews, and textual analysis, reveal the impact of a heterogeneity of practices of evaluation and other forms of interaction between the author of the theorem and a varied community of interlocutors, especially during the draft stage of the theorem. Individual and collective representations of the theorem were structured by the proliferation and polysemy of its reformulations, by the imperfect access to proofs and counterproofs, and by the coordination of action within opposed groups. The stabilization of debates over, and the certification of, the theorem were not based on the simple victory of one side over another but on relatively unified responses by critics and by the author's responses to critiques—responses that tended to allow for multiple interpretations. This ethnography of logic in development illustrates why sociologists should not consider logic to be just a methodological tool; it is also a privileged object that enables exploration of the material and social forms of intellectual work, including the building of credibility.</jats:p>"

To appreciate human-technology interaction in the clinical setting, augmented intelligence has been proposed as a cognitive extension of AI in health care, emphasizing its assistive and supplementary role to medical professionals. While truly autonomous medical robotic systems are still beyond reach, the virtual component of AI, known as software-type algorithms, is the main component used in dentistry. Because of their powerful capabilities in data analysis, these virtual algorithms are expected to improve the accuracy and efficacy of dental diagnosis, provide visualized anatomic guidance for treatment, simulate and evaluate prospective results, and project the occurrence and prognosis of oral diseases. Potential obstacles in contemporary algorithms that prevent routine implementation of AI include the lack of data curation, sharing, and readability; the inability to illustrate the inner decision-making process; the insufficient power of classical computing; and the neglect of ethical principles in the design of AI frameworks. It is necessary to maintain a proactive attitude toward AI to ensure its affirmative development and promote human-technology rapport to revolutionize dental practice. The present review outlines the progress and potential dental applications of AI in medical-aided diagnosis, treatment, and disease prediction and discusses their data limitations, interpretability, computing power, and ethical considerations, as well as their impact on dentists, with the objective of creating a backdrop for future research in this rapidly expanding arena. </jats:p>"

Expert systems are built by knowledge engineers, specialists in the task known as `knowledge acquisition'.

However, knowledge engineers have a different perspective on why this is so. Typically positivist in approach, they see knowledge acquisition as conceptually straightforward. In their view, it is difficult, not because of the nature of knowledge or the complexity of the process, but rather because it requires extended face-to-face interaction between knowledge engineer and expert. Believing that automation will `get around' the inexact and uncontrollable nature of this interaction, they seek to automate it. Drawing on ethnographic material, the paper explores the knowledge engineers' epistemological stance, noting its characteristic deletions, and suggesting that they are reflected in the resultant technology. </jats:p>"

As an area of technological growth and increasing financial investment, we are likely to see more AI-driven technologies in teaching and learning in the post-pandemic ELT world. We are currently in the stage of ‘weak’ AI, which typically performs restricted tasks within specific domains relatively well. However, ‘strong’ AI, equivalent to human intelligence, is the long-term goal, and although this is no more than a theoretical construct at present, we can expect ‘stronger’ AI to emerge over time. ELT will not be immune to this development, and it behoves us as language teachers to be familiar with AI's current benefits and challenges, so that we can better prepare for that future. This article describes how AI is currently used in ELT, and explores some of the opportunities and challenges that AI can provide for learners, teachers and institutions. Ethical issues such as collecting learner data, surveillance and privacy are considered, as well as learner wellbeing and the digital literacies that teachers and learners will need to develop to co-exist in a brave new world of educational AI.

Value creation will be strengthened if AI and ML are conceptualised using theoretical anchors rooted in a strong understanding of employee psychology. Organisations need to address anxieties of employees and assure them that AI and ML are aids in improving their productivity. They need to communicate to employees that AI and ML are not meant to displace employees from their jobs. Organisations face another dilemma regarding how to use AI and ML to draw upon the tacit knowledge and judgement of human actors to make more effective business decisions. </jats:p>

Schwendicke,Journal of Dental Research,2024,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00220345241235606,"<jats:p> With increasing digitalization in orthodontics, certain orthodontic manufacturing processes such as the fabrication of indirect bonding trays, aligner production, or wire bending can be automated. However, orthodontic treatment planning and evaluation remains a specialist’s task and responsibility. As the prediction of growth in orthodontic patients and response to orthodontic treatment is inherently complex and individual, orthodontists make use of features gathered from longitudinal, multimodal, and standardized orthodontic data sets. Currently, these data sets are used by the orthodontist to make informed, rule-based treatment decisions. In research, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied to assist orthodontists with the extraction of relevant data from such data sets. Here, AI has been applied for the analysis of clinical imagery, such as automated landmark detection in lateral cephalograms but also for evaluation of intraoral scans or photographic data. Furthermore, AI is applied to help orthodontists with decision support for treatment decisions such as the need for orthognathic surgery or for orthodontic tooth extractions. One major challenge in current AI research in orthodontics is the limited generalizability, as most studies use unicentric data with high risks of bias. Moreover, comparing AI across different studies and tasks is virtually impossible as both outcomes and outcome metrics vary widely, and underlying data sets are not standardized. Notably, only few AI applications in orthodontics have reached full clinical maturity and regulatory approval, and researchers in the field are tasked with tackling real-world evaluation and implementation of AI into the orthodontic workflow. </jats:p>"

People hope to use data mining methods to conduct effective research on higher education management, and decision tree classification algorithm as a data analysis method in data mining technology, high-precision classification accuracy, intuitive decision results, and high generalization ability make it become a more ideal method of higher education management. Aiming at the sensitivity of data processing and decision tree classification to noisy data, this paper proposes corresponding improvements, and proposes a variable precision rough set attribute selection standard based on scale function, which considers both the weighted approximation accuracy and attribute value of the attribute. The number improves the anti-interference ability of noise data, reduces the bias in attribute selection, and improves the classification accuracy. At the same time, the suppression factor threshold, support and confidence are introduced in the tree pre-pruning process, which simplifies the tree structure. The comparative experiments on standard data sets show that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is better than other decision tree algorithms and can effectively realize the differentiated classification of higher education management.</jats:p>"

In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional translation methods in grammatical variables, such as semantic ambiguity, quantifier errors, low translation accuracy, improve the quality and speed of English translation, and get more accurate and speed guaranteed translation, this study proposes an artificial intelligence English audio translation cross language system based on fuzzy algorithm. In this experiment, the collected analog speech signal is converted into a digital speech signal, and then, the speech features are modeled and digitized, and the whole set of speech samples are integrated and modified to eliminate the interference caused by noise as far as possible. After that, the collected voice will be stored in the text format, and then the text will be translated to achieve English audio translation. The DNN-HMM speech recognition model and the traditional GMM-HMM speech recognition model are used to preprocess the original corpus, and the accuracy of the corpus processing is compared. After that, the accuracy and utilization of the fuzzy algorithm are evaluated between the first type TSK and the second type TSK. For speech synthesis in which the corpus lacks language, it is meaningful to explore the least amount of training data for the synthesis of acceptable speech. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the fuzzy algorithm is about 97.34%, and the utilization rate is about 98.14%. The accuracy rate of type 1 and type 2 algorithms are about 85.77% and 76.87% respectively, and the utilization rate is about 83.25% and 78.63% respectively. The fuzzy algorithm based artificial intelligence English audio translation cross language system is obviously better than the other two algorithms.</jats:p>"

There have been no inquiries overseen in Kerala to explore the opinions of medical students regarding the consumption of AI in health care or their level of understanding of AI. We seek to evaluate the depths of Kerala’s medical learners concerning AI, both in the field of health care and its potential integration into the medical program. Methods: A digital scrutiny apparatus was created through a thorough examination of existing text and collaboration with doyens in the field. The inquiry was tested with a trio of medical learners and improved based on their valuable input. We distributed a digital probe to all medical pupils in Kerala, which amounted to around 20,000 students. The survey was available for responses from April 1st, 2024 to June 1st, 2024. The students’ responses were carefully analysed, both in terms of categories and the content of their free text comments. The analysis was conducted using open coding techniques to ensure a thorough qualitative analysis. Results: In total, 1000 students provided comprehensive answers to all the questions. A significant proportion of students (82.0%) fell within the age range of 20-29 years, pursuing medicine as their undergraduate degree (85%). Many students showed a keen interest in AI, with a significant majority (79.9%) expressing their curiosity. A large percentage (83.1%) asserted to have a basic realizing of AI, but when it came to the fundamental computational principles of AI, only a minority (39.8%) agreed that they grasped them. Similarly, more than half of the students (51.6%) acknowledged their lack of knowledge regarding the limitations of AI. Most students (81.1%) had not obtained any instruction in AI. A significant portion of students (57.3%) expressed their support for incorporating AI into medical training, while a majority (76.2%) expressed a desire for increased emphasis on teaching AI in medicine. A significant portion (61.3%) of medical students expressed a lack of worry about the potential effect of AI on their job safety as doctors. According to the survey, the majority of students believe that radiology, pathology, and medical administration are the specialties that will be most affected by AI. On the other hand, psychiatry, palliative care, and obstetrics and gynaecology are considered to be the least likely to be stuck by AI. Through qualitative study of the free text notes, it was discovered that AI is viewed as a valuable tool rather than a replacement for doctors. This finding emerged as a common theme. Conclusion: It seems that medical students in Kerala have shown a keen interest in AI. However, their knowledge about AI is limited and they feel they lack a deep understanding of its fundamental computational principles and limitations. It seems that AI is currently lacking in the medical curriculum in Kerala and India, and a majority of surveyed students expressed their support for its implementation. These findings align with previous surveys conducted on a global scale. </jats:p>"

In computed tomography (CT), AI holds the promise of enabling further reductions in patient radiation dose through automation and optimisation of data acquisition processes, including patient positioning and acquisition parameter settings. Subsequent to data collection, optimisation of image reconstruction parameters, advanced reconstruction algorithms, and image denoising methods improve several aspects of image quality, especially in reducing image noise and enabling the use of lower radiation doses for data acquisition. Finally, AI-based methods to automatically segment organs or detect and characterise pathology have been translated out of the research environment and into clinical practice to bring automation, increased sensitivity, and new clinical applications to patient care, ultimately increasing the benefit to the patient from medically justified CT examinations. In summary, since the introduction of CT, a large number of technical advances have enabled increased clinical benefit and decreased patient risk, not only by reducing radiation dose, but also by reducing the likelihood of errors in the performance and interpretation of medically justified CT examinations. </jats:p>"

            Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is changing human–machine interactions and the broader information ecosystem. Much as social media algorithms personalize online experiences, GenAI applications can align with user preferences to customize the way individuals interact with information. However, through training, fine-tuning, and prompting, GenAI applications can introduce a new level of customization:
            <jats:italic>hypercustomization.</jats:italic>
            By dynamically tailoring responses to an individual’s explicit and implicit preferences, hypercustomization can reinforce biases, false beliefs, or misconceptions. As a result, it can heighten significant societal challenges, such as the spread of misinformation and political and social polarization. In this article, we explore the risks associated with hypercustomization and the governance and behavioral challenges that might impede effective risk mitigation. These challenges include a lack of transparency in GenAI applications, opacity of the nature of their interactions with users, users’ overreliance on these systems, and the inefficacy of warning messages. We also provide recommendations for overcoming these challenges.

The objective of the study is to create a patient satisfaction model and validate it with respect to factors influencing patient satisfaction of several patients undergoing AI treatment factors. In the study, the United States, Canada, Australia, UAE and China were chosen as a place of survey, as these are advanced countries and the use of AI is highest in these countries compared to other countries, and survey was done with the help of structured questionnaire. In our earlier study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed for initial knowledge development on the construct of patients undergoing AI treatment. Patient satisfaction rests on six broad dimensions: First factor is personal touch (PT), second factor is comprehensive gap (CG), third factor is answerability (AB), fourth factor is nerve racking (NR), fifth factor is wrong reporting (WR) and sixth factor is enlightened (EL). With the help of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structured equation modelling (SEM), it has emerged from the study that patient satisfaction level of the construct suggests that PT will have a greater impact on patient satisfaction, and it is the most significant factor of patient satisfaction compared to other constructs. Thus, we can conclude that PT still remains the most important factor in the minds of patients before undergoing AI treatment.</jats:p>"

If the initial damage is not detected in time, it can develop further causing safety hazards. Therefore, accurate detection of bridge damage is an important topic. In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has been developed rapidly, especially machine learning algorithms, which have shown amazing results in various fields while it also received attention in bridge inspection. This paper summarizes the progress of bridge damage detection research related to artificial intelligence techniques between 2015 and 2021. For structural health monitoring, sensing data is the basis for various data processing methods. The strength and weakness of the sensing data itself directly affect the effectiveness of subsequent processing methods. As a result, this paper classifies bridge damage detection studies into six categories from the types of sensing data: visual image, point cloud, infrared thermal imaging, ground-penetrating radar, vibration response, and other types of data. These six types of damage detection methods were reviewed and summarized respectively. Finally, challenges and future trends were discussed. </jats:p>"

Our specific interest lies in how AI policies tap into both problem-solving approaches and affective registers to achieve both physical and ontological securities. We find that in governmental visions, AI is perceived as a capability that enhances societal and geopolitical interests while its risks are framed as manageable. This echoes strands within human–computer interaction that draw on human-centered perceptions of technology and assumptions about human–AI relationships of trust. Despite different cultural and institutional settings, the visions of future AI development are shaped by this (shared) understanding of human–AI interaction, offering common ground in the navigation of innovation policies. </jats:p>"

The reaction time would be reduced by the power of AI that can process the huge amount of data coming from sensors and with the information regarding the situation could make decision much faster than men. The aim of the research is to denote several situations and possibilities that are capable of deceiving, diverting, capturing a self-driving car or even turning it against the other vehicles by influencing the decision-making of the artificial intelligence. In this paper I will discuss several situations that might be able to confuse the artificial intelligence of the autonomous vehicles or to make them come to an inadequate decision. You can see that safe decision-making depends on the teaching method of the artificial intelligence as well as the correctness of the data uploaded.

This lack of clarity is one hurdle to motivating diversity in AI. Another hurdle is that while the most common perceptions about what diversity is are too weak to do the work set out for them, stronger notions of diversity are often defended on normative grounds that fail to connect to the values that are important to decision-makers in AI. However, there is a long history of research in feminist philosophy of science and a recent body of work in social epistemology that taken together provide the foundation for a notion of diversity that is both strong enough to do the work demanded of it, and can be defended on epistemic grounds that connect with the values that are important to decision-makers in AI. We clarify and defend that notion here by introducing emergent expertise as a network phenomenon wherein groups of workers with expertise of different types can gain knowledge not available to any individual alone, as long as they have ways of communicating across types of expertise. We illustrate the connected epistemic and ethical benefits of designing technology with diverse groups of workers using the examples of an infamous racist soap dispenser, and the millimeter wave scanners used in US airport security. </jats:p>"

We provide a definition of the concept of AI coaching and differentiate it from related concepts. We also challenge the assumption that AI coaching is feasible by challenging its capability to lead through a systematic coaching process and to establish a working alliance to clients. Based on these evaluations, AI coaching seems to encounter the greatest difficulties in the clients’ problem identification and in delivering individual feedback, which may limit its effectiveness. However, AI generally appears capable of guiding clients through many steps in the coaching process and establishing working alliances. We offer specific recommendations for HRD professionals and organizations, coaches, and developers of AI coaching programs on how AI coaching can contribute to enhance coaching practice. Combined with its lower costs and wider target group, AI coaching will likely transform the coaching profession and provide a future HRD tool. </jats:p>"

However, understanding is not a piece of knowledge, a method or an ability. Knowledge can be possessed as an impersonal and public resource. In a certain sense, it can be objectified by a group's understanding, which is characterized by certainty, whereas understanding seems to be in a state of constant transformation and movement. Moreover, a method cannot be separated from the subject and is always subsumed by understanding and interpretation. For a method to be useful, it must be the product of understanding and interpretation. Understanding is not enabled by a method; rather, it is understanding that possesses the method. Finally, understanding cannot be described and defined simply as ability. As an important manifestation of human intelligence, understanding is not an empty shell of method filled by its objects, but an appreciation and extension of the meaning of the objects. Computers are good at dealing with simple and formalized activities that are not associated with a context, but the human activities of understanding are not formalized. From the perspective of philosophical hermeneutics, understanding is filled with elements of reflection and in itself is a form of self-understanding. Furthermore, AI lacks the fore-structure of human understanding. Therefore, whether understanding can be viewed from the perspective of historicity is an important difference between human intelligence and AI, and the missing historical connection of computational programs of AI may be an important reason why it cannot acquire understanding in a real sense. </jats:p>"

This article theoretically explores news automation by adopting a system of professions framework from the sociology of professions to provide a holistic perspective on the impact of artificial intelligence on journalistic work. This framework posits that different factors influence professional control over work, and problems caused by these factors have left journalism vulnerable to automation. The routine and mundane nature of a significant portion of journalistic tasks suggests that artificial intelligence may potentially replace many journalists in the future, thereby challenging the profession’s claim to expertise. For journalism to uphold its professional authority in the future, it needs to brace for the impact of artificial intelligence. Building on this analysis, we explore strategies for journalism to do so. This involves reinforcing professional ideals in new algorithmic practices, readjusting knowledge and skill taught in education, and reclaiming specialised work practices in organisations. Rather than a threat, the emergence of artificial intelligence then presents an opportunity for journalism to reintroduce the distinctiveness of the profession and rejuvenate its professional promise.</jats:p>"

This technology is an important part of speech signal processing technology. With the continuous progress of science and technology, its application in various fields is gradually improving, among which voice noise reduction technology has also been well developed. Especially in recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence science and technology, anti-network speech denoising technology based on deep learning has been derived. Compared with traditional speech denoising techniques, it has better performance in resolving speech data distortion and denoising results. However, in practical applications, this method still has some shortcomings, such as: some unique noises are not removed, and the effective information extraction is distorted under the background of high-intensity noise. In response to these outstanding problems, this research is based on the anti-network speech denoising technology, combined with the Wiener filter speech denoising algorithm, and applies artificial intelligence technology to network security technology management. In this paper, two algorithms, COVL and SSNR, are used to compare the original input speech data signal with noise and the speech data signal preprocessed by Wiener filtering. The additional information is input into the generation network and the discriminant network, and the additional information is used to guide the data generation. The least squares loss function of the binary coding algorithm is used to replace the cross entropy loss function, so that the original discriminant network loss function is not changed, which improves the accuracy of discrimination. This improved technology is superior in terms of speed, productivity and improved accuracy. While building the system, mature network technologies and equipment applications are fully applied, and speech de-noising technology is used for network security situation assessment and prediction simulation tests. The simulation test results show that the network security situation assessment is reasonable and effective, and the prediction is accurate in real time.</jats:p>"

Starting from improving the shortcomings of the traditional Web-based distance teaching system, it strives to increase learners’ self-directed learning interest, monitor students’ emotions, and exchange knowledge between teaching agents. To realize students’ on-demand learning according to their aptitude, teachers’ teaching ultimately improve the system’s flexibility, personalization, and artificial intelligence. Under the guidance of learning communities and other theories, construct learner model ontology inference rules. Based on the learner’s relationship characteristics, the knowledge domain that the learner is interested in is inferred, thus constructing an intelligent information retrieval system. Knowledge retrieval is realized quickly and accurately, thereby verifying the application of learner relationship characteristics in digital learning.</jats:p>"

Scientific fields relevant to understanding the mechanisms of these interactions are as diverse as evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, ecomorphology, molecular biology, phylogeny, neurosciences, physiology, biomechanics, and robotics. The difficulty in understanding these mechanisms lies therefore (1) in the multi- and interdisciplinary nature of this issue, and (2) in keeping up with very rapid developments in various scientific fields. This Special Issue provides an interdisciplinary approach to predator–prey interactions to identify how phenotypic traits of both types of organisms interact and how each can act as a selective pressure on the evolution of a population of organisms at the different levels of the trophic chain. Moreover, we show that confronting bodies of knowledge that a priori appear as remote as those of robotics and experimental biology or ecology may seem difficult but can provide reciprocal understanding. </jats:p>"

Many have started experimenting with generative AI. However, in countries with strong economies, or in newsrooms funded by strong economies like in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, news organizations have endorsed AI technologies beyond ChatGPT and similar tools. The majority of Arab journalists, however, are yet to understand what is meant by AI. Very few news organizations in the region have strategically approached the question of AI. Arab newsrooms need to examine when and why they need to use AI technologies, whether they have the infrastructure or can afford the resources. Implementing AI in Arab newsrooms presents an additional set of challenges, including language complexities, cultural sensitivities, potential biases in algorithms, and the need for tailored solutions that resonate with local audiences. The ethical implications present its own set of challenges. ChatGPT has proven to generate inaccurate data in Arabic. Resources are to be put in place to ensure the model is trained on a diverse and comprehensive dataset of Arabic text. Implementing bias detection and mitigation techniques to ensure the models are free from biases and offensive content is crucial. Newsrooms operating in authoritarian regimes have to be aware of governments' attempts to use generative AI to whitewash and promote state-centered actions and policies.

The issue of network security has also begun to be paid attention to. In recent years, due to the rapid expansion of network applications, malicious events such as network threats have occurred from time to time. Many computers do not have a good protection structure so that they are often vulnerable to attacks during network interconnection. Traditional computer protection measures are border-based protection, but with the development of network technology, this protection system can no longer guarantee computer security. Therefore, in order to keep computers safe in the current network environment, the role of artificial intelligence in the computer field should be given full play. The artificial intelligence analysis system can analyze and predict the situation of computer network security based on the situation of network security. This paper integrates convolutional neural network algorithms on the basis of traditional machine learning to establish a new network intrusion model. This paper verifies the feasibility of the model through experiments, and the experimental results show that the accuracy of the new model proposed in this paper can reach more than 90% for KDDCUP99 data detection. In addition, traditional computer protection systems have many errors when dealing with DNN attack detection. In order to reduce the occurrence of this situation, this paper proposes a standardized attack detection model based on deep nerves. The detection precision of this model is higher and the results obtained are more accurate. In addition, this new model can also synthesize the impact of different network attacks on the security situation, and construct attack situation predictions for computer systems.</jats:p>"

AI is an advanced information communication technology tool (ICT) that changes both the nature of human discretion within a bureaucracy and the structure of bureaucracies. To better understand this relationship, AI, discretion, and bureaucracy are explored in some detail. It is argued that discretion and decision-making are strongly influenced by intelligence, and that improvements in intelligence, such as those that can be found within the field of AI, can help improve the overall quality of administration. Furthermore, the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of both human discretion and AI are explored. Once these characteristics are laid out, a further exploration of the role AI may play in bureaucracies and bureaucratic structure is presented, followed by a specific focus on systems-level bureaucracies. In addition, it is argued that task distribution and task characteristics play a large role, along with the organizational and legal context, in whether a task favors human discretion or the use of AI. Complexity and uncertainty are presented as the major defining characteristics for categorizing tasks. Finally, a discussion is provided about the important cautions and concerns of utilizing AI in governance, in particular, with respect to existential risk and administrative evil. </jats:p>"

These disparities raise pressing questions about how using artificial intelligence can work to promote justice or entrench injustice. Political theorists and philosophers have developed nuanced vocabularies and theoretical frameworks for understanding and adjudicating disputes about what justice requires and what constitutes injustice. The interdisciplinary community committed to understanding and conscientiously using big data could benefit from this work. Thus, in the spirit of encouraging cross-disciplinary dialogue and collaboration, this piece examines contemporary scholarship in political theory and philosophy to illustrate some of the vocabularies and frameworks political theorists and philosophers have developed for thinking about justice and injustice. It then draws on these frameworks to illuminate how the use of artificial intelligence can implicate questions of justice, with a focus on institutional discrimination, structural injustice, and epistemic injustice. Ultimately, the piece argues that the use of artificial intelligence—far from representing a decision to take power out of human hands—represents a novel way of harnessing human power, making questions of justice central to its conscientious undertaking. </jats:p>"

We propose two AI distractor-generating methods for creating Chinese vocabulary items: semantic similarity and visual similarity. Semantic similarity refers to antonyms and synonyms, while visual similarity refers to the phenomenon that two phrases share one or more characters in common. This study explores the construct validity of the two types of selected-response vocabulary tests (AI-generated items and human expert-designed items) and compares their item difficulty and item discrimination. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Seventy-eight students from Beijing Language and Culture University were asked to respond to AI-generated and human expert-designed items respectively. Students’ scores were analyzed using the two-parameter item response theory (2PL-IRT) model. Thirteen students were then invited to report their test taking strategies in the think-aloud section. The findings from the students’ item responses revealed that the human expert-designed items were easier but had more discriminating power than the AI-generated items. The results of think-aloud data indicated that the AI-generated items and expert-designed items might assess different constructs, in which the former elicited test takers’ bottom-up test-taking strategies while the latter seemed more likely to trigger test takers’ rote memorization ability. </jats:p>"

However, its performance is greatly operator dependent. Studies have shown that up to one-quarter of colorectal polyps can be missed on a single colonoscopy, leading to high rates of interval colorectal cancer. In addition, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has proposed the “resect-and-discard” and “diagnose-and-leave” strategies for diminutive colorectal polyps to reduce the costs of unnecessary polyp resection and pathology evaluation. However, the performance of optical biopsy has been suboptimal in community practice. With recent improvements in machine-learning techniques, artificial intelligence–assisted computer-aided detection and diagnosis have been increasingly utilized by endoscopists. The application of computer-aided design on real-time colonoscopy has been shown to increase the adenoma detection rate while decreasing the withdrawal time and improve endoscopists’ optical biopsy accuracy, while reducing the time to make the diagnosis. These are promising steps toward standardization and improvement of colonoscopy quality, and implementation of “resect-and-discard” and “diagnose-and-leave” strategies. Yet, issues such as real-world applications and regulatory approval need to be addressed before artificial intelligence models can be successfully implemented in clinical practice.

AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected.

As states race forward to achieve superiority in artificial intelligence, including its military applications, NATO allies and partner nations on both sides of the Atlantic have a strong incentive to cooperate closely and ensure the collective West can maintain its technological edge. However, large gaps remain between the US and the EU on certain key indicators. To ensure greater European performance and relevance, it is desirable to focus on two strategic priorities: investment volumes, both public and private, which need to be significantly increased; and the full use of collaborative mechanisms involving the US. </jats:p>"

Through a narrative review of existing research, this paper synthesises findings from previous digital government implementations on the African continent, and considers the implications for AI use. The analysis is centred on the way public officials are bypassed or empowered to work with emerging technologies, and the influence of public service values on their adoption. Four concerns emerge as relevant: Integrity of recommendations provided by decision-support systems, including how they are influenced by local organisational practices and the reliability of underlying infrastructures; Inclusive decision-making that balances the (assumed) objectivity of data-driven algorithms and the influence of different stakeholder groups; Exception and accountability in how digital and AI platforms are funded, developed, implemented and used; and an expectation of Complete understanding of people and events through the integration of traditionally dispersed data sources and systems, and how policy actors seek to mitigate the risks associated with this aspiration. </jats:p>"

The labour of these workers is, among other things, a crucial component in the production, development and support of artificial intelligence. Crowdwork platforms are an extreme example of new forms of automated measurement, management and control of labour allowing, in turn, for the creation of hyperflexible and highly scalable workforces. Particularly on so-called microtask platforms, work is characterised by decomposition, standardisation, automated management and surveillance, as well as algorithmically organised cooperation between a great number of workers. Analysing these platforms as a paradigmatic example of an emerging digital Taylorism, the article goes on to argue that this allows the platforms to assemble a deeply heterogeneous set of workers while bypassing the need to spatially and subjectively homogenise them. These platforms create a global on-demand workforce, working in their private homes or Internet cafes. As a result, crowdwork taps into labour pools hitherto almost inaccessible to wage labour. The second part of the article investigates this tendency by looking at two sets of workers: women shouldering care responsibilities, who now can work on crowdwork platforms while performing domestic labour, as well as digital workers in the Global South. While there are clear specifics of digital crowdwork, it is also an expression of broader transformations within the world of work, concerning, for example, new forms of algorithmic management just as the return of very old forms of exploitation such as the piece wage. </jats:p>"

To this end, we describe a socio-cognitive architecture that conceptualizes how boundedly rational individuals coordinate their cognitive resources and diverse goals to accomplish joint action. Our transactive systems framework articulates the inter-member processes underlying the emergence of collective memory, attention, and reasoning, which are fundamental to intelligence in any system. Much like the cognitive architectures that have guided the development of artificial intelligence, our transactive systems framework holds the potential to be formalized in computational terms to deepen our understanding of collective intelligence and pinpoint roles that AI can play in enhancing it. </jats:p>"

It can make full use of the advantages of the network across regions, and make full use of the advantages of network technology to share the resources of colleges and universities, which is a promising educational method. In response to the demand of online education for learner information, this paper proposes the learner model Neighbor Mean Variation Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (NMVMOPSO-GA). This model includes the learner’s learning interest sub-model, the learner’s cognitive ability sub-model and the learner’s knowledge sub-model. The modelling techniques of the three sub-models are discussed separately, and their status and role in the online education system are analyzed. At the same time, for the knowledge model that reflects the learner’s learning progress and knowledge mastery, a learner knowledge sub-model constructed with Bayesian networks is proposed. The neighbor mean mutation operator is introduced to optimize the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and improve the convergence performance and stability of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. We study the application of multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in online course resource generation service. Through simulation experiments, it is verified that the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm can improve the performance and stability of online course resource generation.</jats:p>"

            <jats:title>Statement of the problem</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Both humans and AI detection technologies have difficulty distinguishing between AI-generated vs. human-authored text. This weakness raises a significant possibility of false positive errors: human-authored writing incorrectly judged as AI-generated.</jats:p>

This simplification underlying contemporary mythology of knowledge arises from fear of the power and change that science entails, leaving many people feeling confused and disempowered. It reemerges in the media, most often under the name of “Frankenstein, ” with any new discovery that appears to threaten social equilibrium. This is not a new phenomenon. From medieval stories about alchemists to films about computer hackers, good scientists are in the minority, and the number of recurring stereotypes is small. Seven are identified: the evil alchemist; the noble scientist as hero or savior of society; the foolish scientist, whether the gullible, seventeenth-century virtuoso or the absent-minded professor; the inhuman researcher of romanticism; the scientist as adventurer, transcending boundaries of space and time; the mad, bad, dangerous scientist, unscrupulous in the exercise of power; and the helpless scientist, unable to control the outcome of his or her work. These archetypes offer writers and filmmakers a convenient shorthand, a matrix in which to slot contemporary scientists and their projects, simplifying the issues. Like all myths, they appear simple but represent complex ideas and suppressed fears, which transcend time, place, and race. </jats:p>"

In addition, SMEs use e-commerce websitesas sales channels between the businesses, their competitor, and consumers. Between the success of e-commerce and manufacturing SMEs, however, the moderating influence of entrepreneurial competencies does not seem to be as significant. Hence, in this paper, Deep Convolutional Neural Network based onSales Prediction Model (DCNN-SPM) has been suggested for analyzing SME enterprises’ e-commerce utilization and development. Consistent with the user decision-making requirements of online product sales, united with the impelling factors of online product sales in different SME industries and the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study builds a sales prediction model appropriate for online products. Furthermore, it evaluates the model’s adaptability to different types of online products.

Yet, there is limited understanding of this evolving landscape. We conduct an interview-based study of 34 individuals in the AI ethics auditing ecosystem across seven countries to examine the motivations, key auditing activities, and challenges associated with AI ethics auditing in the private sector. We find that AI ethics audits follow financial auditing stages, but tend to lack robust stakeholder involvement, measurement of success, and external reporting. Audits are hyper-focused on technically oriented AI ethics principles of bias, privacy, and explainability, to the exclusion of other principles and socio-technical approaches, reflecting a regulatory emphasis on technical risk management. Auditors face challenges, including competing demands across interdisciplinary functions, firm resource and staffing constraints, lack of technical and data infrastructure to enable auditing, and significant ambiguity in interpreting regulations and standards given limited (or absent) best practices and tractable regulatory guidance. Despite these roadblocks, AI ethics and governance auditors are playing a critical role in the early ecosystem: building auditing frameworks, interpreting regulations, curating practices, and sharing learnings with auditees, regulators, and other stakeholders. </jats:p>"

While using AI can enhance the integrity of published manuscripts, it can also increase the risk of false/unsubstantiated allegations. Ambiguities related to journals’ and publishers’ responsibilities concerning fairness and transparency also raise ethical concerns. In this Topic Piece, we offer the following guidance: (1) All cases of suspected misconduct identified by AI tools should be carefully reviewed by humans to verify accuracy and ensure accountability; (2) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should use only well-tested and reliable tools, remain vigilant concerning forms of misconduct that cannot be detected by these tools, and stay abreast of advancements in technology; (3) Journals/publishers should inform authors about irregularities identified by AI tools and give them a chance to respond before forwarding allegations to their institutions in accordance with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines; (4) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should screen all relevant submissions and not just random/purposefully selected submissions; and (5) Journals should inform authors about their definition of misconduct, their use of AI tools to detect misconduct, and their policies and procedures for responding to suspected cases of misconduct. </jats:p>"

But it cannot solve the semantic problem of artificial intelligence. This requires improving the semantic understanding ability of artificial intelligence. Therefore, a question answering system based on semantic problem processing is proposed in this study. The question answering system utilizes an improved unsupervised method to extract keywords. This technology integrates the semantic feature information of text into traditional word graph model algorithms. On this basis, semantic similarity information is used to calculate and allocate the initial values and edge weights of each node in the PageRank model. And corresponding restart probability matrices and transition probability matrices are constructed for iterative calculation and keyword extraction. Simultaneously, an improved semantic dependency tree was utilized for answer extraction. The improved keyword extraction method shows a decreasing trend in P and R values. The improved answer extraction method has a maximum P-value of 0.876 in the training set and 0.852 in the test set. In a question answering system based on keyword and answer extraction, the improved method has lower loss function values and running time. The improved method has a larger area under ROC. The results of the validation analysis confirm that the improved method in this experiment has high accuracy and robustness when dealing with semantic problems.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of AI presents significant risks and hurdles, sparking apprehension regarding the trustworthiness of AI systems by humans. Lately, numerous governmental entities have introduced regulations and principles aimed at fostering trustworthy AI systems, while companies, research institutions, and public sector organizations have released their own sets of principles and guidelines for ensuring ethical and trustworthy AI. Additionally, they have developed methods and software toolkits to aid in evaluating and improving the attributes of trustworthiness. The present paper aims to explore this evolution by analysing and supporting the trustworthiness of AI systems. We commence with an examination of the characteristics inherent in trustworthy AI, along with the corresponding principles and standards associated with them. We then examine the methods and tools that are available to designers and developers in their quest to operationalize trusted AI systems. Finally, we outline research challenges towards end-to-end engineering of trustworthy AI by-design.</jats:p>"

With increasing interest in hydrogen storage applications, a comprehensive understanding of CFRP’s microstructure is crucial. However, there remains a critical gap in effectively linking microstructural characteristics to multiscale simulation models for improved tank design. This study presents a detailed analysis of CFRP microstructure using micro-section image analysis. Advanced artificial intelligence techniques, including transfer learning with VGG16 and XGBoost, are employed to detect fibers and matrix-rich regions. Notably, the model achieves an impressive Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) of 0.89, providing strong quantitative validation. Furthermore, the experimentally determined fiber volume fraction of 0.59 closely aligns with the predicted value of 0.589, demonstrating the model’s accuracy. The investigation extends to analyzing fiber distribution using statistical features such as Voronoi polygons and kernel density estimation. Through dimensionality reduction via t-SNE and clustering, distinct patterns in CFRP’s microstructure are identified, offering deeper insights into its complexity. Finally, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework is implemented using a surrogate model to map the decision-making process to microstructure characteristics. The surrogate model achieves an F1-score of 0.90, reinforcing the reliability of the approach. This research provides valuable insights into the distinct categories in CFRP’s microstructure, particularly relevant for utilization in multiscale numerical methods.</jats:p>"

            This study explores student-initiated translanguaging in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context, particularly with AI translation tools, an area largely overlooked in favor of teacher-led approaches. Using a sequential explanatory mixed-method design, the research examined how 69 undergraduates at a Thai university, across various disciplines, integrated AI translation tools into their English learning, focusing on communicative competence within the frameworks of the Optimal Input Hypothesis and Translanguaging Theory. Data were collected through surveys, speaking assessments, and narrative frames, with quantitative data analyzed via path analysis and qualitative data through thematic analysis. The findings reveal a strong reliance on AI tools for comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and building linguistic confidence, as indicated by high mean scores. Nonetheless, although these tools were effective in enhancing comprehension and shaping student preferences, they also showed a tendency to reduce overall usage due to increased proficiency or potential over-reliance. Qualitative results further accentuated the importance of these tools in decoding complex texts, aiding comprehension, and verifying understanding, with convenience being a major driver of their use. Despite these benefits, path analysis indicated that the impact of AI tools on speaking skills was not statistically significant (β = −.1044,
            <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>
            = .512), raising concerns that frequent reliance on these tools may not substantially improve speaking abilities and might even hinder deeper language mastery. These findings highlight the need for further research to better understand the comprehensive effects of AI-powered translanguaging on language learning outcomes.

The deep learning techniques used are neural network regression, decision forest regression, boosted decision tree regression and multi class logistic regression. The best technique is identified. In the perspective data analytics, it is suggested what the airlines should do for the on-time performance in the disrupted situation. The performances of all the methods are satisfactory. The coefficient of determination for the neural network regression is 0.86 and for decision forest regression is 0.85, respectively. The coefficient of determination for the boosted decision tree is 0.870984. Thus boosted decision tree regression is better. Multi class logistic regression gives an overall accuracy and precision of 98.4%. Recalling/remembering performance is 99%. Thus multi class logistic regression is the best model for prediction of flight delays in the COVID-19. The confusion matrix for the multi class logistic regression shows that 87.2% flights actually not delayed are predicted not delayed. The flights actually not delayed but wrongly predicted delayed are12.7%. The strength of relation with departure delay, carrier delay, late aircraft delay, weather delay and NAS delay, are 94%, 53%, 35%, 21%, and 14%, respectively. There is a weak negative relation (almost unrelated) with the air time and arrival delay. Security delay and arrival delay are also almost unrelated with strength of 1% relationship. Based on these diagnostic analytics, it is recommended as perspective to take due care reducing departure delay, carrier delay, Late aircraft delay, weather delay and Nas delay, respectively, considerably with effect of 94%, 53%, 35%, 21%, and 14% in disrupted situations. The proposed models have MAE of 2% for Neural Network Regression, Decision Forest Regression, Boosted Decision Tree Regression, respectively, and, RMSE approximately, 11%, 12%, 11%, respectively.</jats:p>"

These systems are trained to spot objectionable content and to remove it, block it, or filter it out before it is even uploaded. Artificial intelligence filters offer a robust approach to content moderation which is shaping the public sphere. This dramatic shift in norm setting and law enforcement is potentially game-changing for democracy. Artificial intelligence filters carry censorial power, which could bypass traditional checks and balances secured by law. Their opaque and dynamic nature creates barriers to oversight, and conceals critical value choices and tradeoffs. Currently, we lack adequate tools to hold them accountable. This paper seeks to address this gap by introducing an adversarial procedure— – Contesting Algorithms. It proposes to deliberately introduce friction into the dominant removal systems governed by artificial intelligence. Algorithmic content moderation often seeks to optimize a single goal, such as removing copyright-infringing materials or blocking hate speech, while other values in the public interest, such as fair use or free speech, are often neglected. Contesting algorithms introduce an adversarial design which reflects conflicting values, and thereby may offer a check on dominant removal systems. Facilitating an adversarial intervention may promote democratic principles by keeping society in the loop. An adversarial public artificial intelligence system could enhance dynamic transparency, facilitate an alternative public articulation of social values using machine learning systems, and restore societal power to deliberate and determine social tradeoffs. </jats:p>"

In addition, the discovery of ideas, sentiments, tendencies, and context requires that our modelling algorithms be aware of many different features such as the words themselves, length of sentences (and paragraphs), word frequency counts, phrases, punctuation, number of references, and links. Overfitting can be counterbalanced by Regularization, but the latter can also cause problems.

Through ethnographic observation and interviews in French field sites, we show how in radiology a specific definition of “normal” bodies, embedded within detection tools, conflicts with medical practice, and the way in which non-consensual knowledge in archaeology can challenge the prediction of soil occupation in a prehistoric site. We also highlight the conditions under which AI tools can adhere to certain epistemic norms and become part of professional practices in radiology and prehistoric archaeology. While in radiology AI is judged by its ability to close uncertainties without imposing binary categories, in prehistoric archaeology, its epistemic validity depends on mobilizing exogenous scientific data to increase researchers’ reflexivity about their practices and knowledge, suggesting new clues and explanatory paths.

If the essence of humanity lies in creativity, and if AI can replicate this trait, it appears that creativity alone does not define what it means to be human. Rather than perceiving this as an ‘anthropological loss’ to be accepted or fought against, it can be viewed as an occasion to contemplate the human from a more-than-human perspective. By considering this perspective, it becomes evident that the definition of humanity has been a matter of dispute long preceding the recent advancements in AI. A theoretical approach to the relationship between AI, creativity and more-than-humanness is proposed as a way to show the possibilities that philosophy brings to counteract pessimistic approaches to the replaceability of the human by AI. By challenging the notion that humans are the sole proprietors of creativity, one can explore alternative forms of creativity beyond the human realm and consider how humans can facilitate their emergence. </jats:p>"

Using the case study of Silicon Valley’s Anduril, the article focuses on the US–Mexico border and assesses AI’s role in hindering illegalised mobility and reconfiguring border control. Two key contributions are made in the paper. First, AI advances must become the focus of border criminologies, examined within the milieu from which the technology emerged. Second, virtual walls are commercial, political and anti-humanitarian. They are opaque, resembling alchemy, flawed but with profound consequences.

This article explores the realm of cyberethics (a field of applied ethics that focuses on the ethical, legal, and social implications of cybertechnology), highlighting the ethical principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, and explicability as a roadmap for facilitating AI integration into nursing education. Research findings suggest that ethical dilemmas that challenge these five principles can emerge within the context of nursing education; however, adherence to these very principles, which is essential to improving patient care, can offer solutions to these dilemmas. To ensure the ethical and responsible use of Gen AI in nursing education, these principles must be woven into the fabric of curricula, and appropriate guidelines must be developed. Nurse educators have a pivotal role in strategizing comprehensive approaches for ethical AI integration, establishing clear guidelines, and instilling critical thinking among students. Fostering lifelong learning and adaptability is key to ensuring that future nurses can successfully navigate the constantly evolving landscape of health care technology. Future research should investigate the long-term impacts of AI utilization on learning outcomes and ethical decision-making. </jats:p>"

With the proper understanding of these problems, a system can be made that mechanically answers questions and solves problems in a manner which would be described as “intelligent” if performed by a human. Since AI is related to many fields, researchers in other areas desire some understanding of the concepts and principles upon which AI is founded.

This article reviews the extent to which people see AIs as moral agents and patients and how they feel about such AIs. We also examine how characteristics about ourselves and the AIs affect attributions of moral agency and patiency. We find multiple factors that contribute to attributions of moral agency and patiency in AIs, some of which overlap with attributions of morality to humans (e.g., mind perception) and some that are unique (e.g., sci-fi fan identity).

The current research investigates which types of consumers have greater AI receptivity. Contrary to expectations revealed in four surveys, cross-country data and six additional studies find that people with lower AI literacy are typically more receptive to AI. This lower literacy–greater receptivity link is not explained by differences in perceptions of AI's capability, ethicality, or feared impact on humanity. Instead, this link occurs because people with lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as magical and experience feelings of awe in the face of AI's execution of tasks that seem to require uniquely human attributes. In line with this theorizing, the lower literacy–higher receptivity link is mediated by perceptions of AI as magical and is moderated among tasks not assumed to require distinctly human attributes. These findings suggest that companies may benefit from shifting their marketing efforts and product development toward consumers with lower AI literacy.

While there have been growing efforts to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into palliative care practice and research, it remains unclear whether the use of AI can facilitate the goals of palliative care. In this paper, we present three hypothetical case examples of using AI in the palliative care context, covering machine learning algorithms that predict patient mortality, natural language processing models that detect psychological symptoms, and AI chatbots addressing caregivers’ unmet needs. Using these cases, we examine the ethical dimensions of utilizing AI in palliative care by applying five widely accepted moral principles that guide ethical deliberations in AI: beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We address key ethical questions arising from these five core moral principles and analyze the potential impact the use of AI can have on palliative care stakeholders. Applying a critical lens, we assess whether AI can facilitate the primary aim of palliative care to support seriously ill individuals and their families. We conclude by discussing the gaps that need to be further addressed in order to promote ethical and responsible AI usage in palliative care.</jats:p>"

This article examines a physician's decision regarding whether to use AI when prescribing a treatment plan for a patient. Using AI helps the physician generate an informative signal that lessens clinical uncertainty. It can also change the physician's legal liability in the event of patient harm. The authors analyze two patient-protection schemes that determine physician liability when using AI: The prevailing patient-protection scheme uses the AI signal to enforce the current standard of care, whereas an emerging scheme proposes using the AI signal as the new standard of care. They show that in both schemes, the physician has an incentive to use AI in low-uncertainty scenarios, even if AI provides little value. Furthermore, the physician may avoid using AI in higher-uncertainty scenarios where AI could have improved decision quality. As the quality of AI improves, the physician may become more hesitant to use it on certain patients. A comparison of the physician's decision to use AI under the two schemes reveals that using the AI signal as the new standard of care may mitigate AI underuse (overuse) for certain patients but may boost AI underuse (overuse) for some other patients.</jats:p>"

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurological disease which is mostly seen in the age of 65 years and above, when they have problems like memory loss, decline in cognitive abilities and changes in mood and personality. We all know that human behavior is mostly based on qualitative facts, which are hard to be measured and cannot be judged easily. Fuzzy logic and AI are certain latest methods to approximate and to bring out a decision or an inference. Through this method, certain linguistic terms are used like very high, high, low, very low etc. and the weights are calculated accordingly, via the response. During final interpretation, the identified parameters are diagnosed through mapping and framing a hierarchy of major subareas to arrive at a subsequent decision. A set of governing parameters are framed and then subparametrs been identified, creating a hierarchy. Thus this tool can be used for final diagnosis of the Alzheimer disease as it is Yes Or No for the concerned patient. </jats:p>"

AI is not limited to specific content, skills, or assessments. Nonetheless, AI has particular relevance to writing instruction. The rules for using AI are new and confusing to students, so they must learn to be transparent and ethical when documenting AI's contributions to their work. Teachers use AI in productive and creative ways, but there is great potential for further development. Although the future of AI is unknown, teachers should engage in professional development to stay up to date on the use of AI in the teaching of psychology.

Purpose: Given AI’s success in large-vessel occlusion (LVO) detection and perfusion mapping delivered to our smartphones, the next leap for this “Ghost in the Machine” technology seems to be into the world of NCP: AI-enhanced logistics have started to help with cardiac monitoring after cryptogenic, large-artery and small-vessel stroke, looking for atrial fibrillation (AF) with an insertable loop recorder (ILR) and/or external patch. Results: The ‘CONNECT’ study from UCSD demonstrated that AI can increase protocol efficiency and reduce patient wait-times for ILR; with more AF detected, fewer strokes may result as more patients receive anticoagulation or Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC). Conclusion: Therefore, organically, the next AI and ML-enhanced NCP frontier may involve inter-departmental “Shared Decision-Making” (SDM) process with LAAC, and/or Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), in appropriately selected patients. In this editorial, we explore AI’s capability to disrupt current antiquated siloed communication tools, refine and streamline SDM processes and tailor patient-specific treatment plans, nevertheless advocating for intercalation of AI into NCP pathways in a secure, ethically-guided manner. </jats:p>"

More recently, with the advent of advances in computing, algorithms enabling machine learning, especially deep learning networks that mimic the human brain in function, there has been renewed interest to use them in clinical medicine. In cardiovascular medicine, AI-based systems have found new applications in cardiovascular imaging, cardiovascular risk prediction, and newer drug targets. This article aims to describe different AI applications including machine learning and deep learning and their applications in cardiovascular medicine. AI-based applications have enhanced our understanding of different phenotypes of heart failure and congenital heart disease. These applications have led to newer treatment strategies for different types of cardiovascular diseases, newer approach to cardiovascular drug therapy and postmarketing survey of prescription drugs. However, there are several challenges in the clinical use of AI-based applications and interpretation of the results including data privacy, poorly selected/outdated data, selection bias, and unintentional continuance of historical biases/stereotypes in the data which can lead to erroneous conclusions.

Scholars agree that AI will have a significant impact on global security, but they disagree on the specific mechanisms and dimensions of this impact. Some focus on changes in the balance of power and the effectiveness of autonomous weapons, while others highlight the tactical advantages, defensive and offensive capabilities, and even national differences in AI development and deployment.

It is inadequately explained in analytic theory. An artificial intelligence model of the process is proposed. Models of problem solving show that the complexity of necessary computation is an important determinant of how a problem is solved. Not optimal, but only good enough solutions are usually found. The quality of solutions depends on the time and resources available. Generally it is far easier to use existing methods than to develop new approaches. When problems must be solved in an emergency fashion, as in trauma, poor solutions are likely to emerge. In studying the annealing of metals and other complex optimization problems, a process, the Boltzman algorithm, was discovered, which continues the search for better solutions while gradually developing a coherent structure of the overall solution. The algorithm provides a model both for psychoanalytic working through and for the normally ongoing process of psychological development and reworking whose deficiency is characteristic of much psychopathology. Working through in the analytic situation is the reactivation of this normal process, and a good analytic outcome is achieved when the process can continue without the analyst. Properties of the Boltzman algorithm clarify such concepts as “optimal” frustration and anxiety which correspond to working in the area where the stable but not rigid structures emerge in the algorithms operation. These studies are an example of how computer science and artificial intelligence area potentially rich source for psychoanalytic theory. </jats:p>"

In that context, our paper uses Canada as a critical case to investigate the relationship between ideals of good government and good technology. We do so through not one, but two Trudeaus—celebrity Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (2015—…) and his equally famous father, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (1968–1979, 1980–1984). Both shared a similar interest in new ideas and practices of both intelligent government and artificial intelligence. Influenced by Marshall McLuhan and his media theory, Pierre Elliott Trudeau deployed new communication technologies to restore centralized control in an otherwise decentralized state. Partly successful, he left his son with an informationally inclined political legacy, which decades later animated Justin Trudeau's own turn toward Big Data and artificial intelligence. Compared with one another, these two visions for both government and artificial intelligence illustrate the broader tensions between cybernetic and neoliberal approaches to government, which inform how new technologies are conceived of, and adopted, as political ones. As this article argues, Canada offers a paradigmatic case for how artificial intelligence is as much shaped by theories of government as by investments and innovations in computing research, which together delimit the contours of intelligence by defining which technical systems, people, and organizations come to be recognized as its privileged bearers. </jats:p>"

Healthcare is using AI to automate tasks such as medical image analysis and diagnosis that require high precision and accuracy. The healthcare industry is significantly impacted by the rapid development of machine learning algorithms, which are frequently implemented using deep learning, as well as the growth of digital data and computing power supported by improvements in hardware technologies. Significant progress has been made in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years and is now widely used in healthcare to automate a variety of tasks, which require a high degree of accuracy and precision. The creation of machine learning algorithms, which can learn from data and make predictions based on that learning, has made it possible to use AI in healthcare. Neural networks are used in deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, to simulate how the human brain functions. Crucial advances have been made in clinical decision support, drug discovery, and medical imaging. Furthermore, the rapid development of hardware technologies, such as graphics processing units, has allowed AI systems to process enormous amounts of data quickly and accurately. Due to this, AI-based tools and platforms can help healthcare professionals with tasks such as patient monitoring, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning. </jats:p>"

The addition of e-commerce has promoted the transformation of these industries to informationization. This study uses the analytical capabilities of artificial intelligence to analyze the utilization rate of e-commerce in smes. The article and research ideas are firstly using artificial intelligence to build an analysis model, and secondly, using the results of model analysis to explore the utilization rate of e-commerce in small and medium-sized enterprises. Finally, according to the current situation of e-commerce utilization rate of small and medium-sized enterprises, relevant growth strategies are put forward. This paper builds an e-commerce application analysis model based on artificial intelligence technology. After multi-layer verification, the model has good performance in theory and practice. Using this model to analyze the application rate of e-commerce in small and medium-sized enterprises, we can find that there are still the following problems in the application of e-commerce in small and medium-sized enterprises. (1) Lack of experience and lack of guiding standards (2) Lack of reasonable business strategies (3) Lack of offline interaction with users. In order to solve these problems, small and medium-sized enterprises should (1) strengthen publicity and innovation and promote brand marketing (2) strengthen the cultivation and construction of talents (3) optimize the industrial model and reduce industrial costs (4) improve the industrial model and marketing of e-commerce system.</jats:p>"

In our past technological society, ‘liberation from nature’ mainly referred to people's physical strength. An intelligent society, characterized by the wide application of the internet, big data and artificial intelligence (AI), will further liberate not only people's physical strength, but also their mental power, greatly changing social forms and social operation modes, as well as people themselves. In the application of technologies and the design and manufacture of equipment on which the intelligent society depends, a new tension is formed between instrumental rationality and value rationality. While promoting the liberation of human beings, intelligent society will also cause humans to be dominated and enslaved by AI, which will lead to human alienation. Intelligent society is more in pursuit of how the invested capital and technology can multiply in the process of accumulation and circulation; meanwhile, it will ignore the moral responsibilities of relevant parties, such as researchers, manufacturers and users. In the process of developing an intelligent society, instrumental rationality should be regulated by value rationality, thus promoting the liberation of human beings and eliminating their alienation.

Proximate ethics of this type includes discussion about fairness, accountability, sustainability and transparency. The second concerns ultimate ethics which focuses on the longer-term impact and implications of AI. Examples of this type might include issues of uniqueness, deep societal transformation and inequality, changes to personal character and even the role AI might have in God's ultimate economy of creation and grace. My contention is that the Christian church needs to attend to both approaches to AI and that when it focuses too myopically on one at the expense of the other it often eclipses the entire witness of the church in our technological society. </jats:p>"

The results show that artificial intelligence promotes the upgrading of export technical complexity in Chinese manufacturing enterprises. The impact of artificial intelligence on upgrading export technical complexity is dynamic, showing an “inverted U-shape.” Heterogeneity test results indicate that artificial intelligence has a greater effect on export technical complexity upgrading if it features high-tech complexity, or the enterprises are local or in the eastern region of China. The mechanism results indicate that artificial intelligence significantly promotes labor productivity and innovation to upgrade China’s manufacturing enterprises’ export technical complexity.

In addition, in order to explore the effect of artificial intelligence sports monitoring model in sports action recognition, this study uses the average recognition rate as a measure of the results of sports action recognition and uses neural network algorithms as a comparative experiment. From the experimental results, it can be seen that the performance of this algorithm is good, and it can be applied to the supervision of college students’ extracurricular physical exercise.</jats:p>"

            With the high incidence of students’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) content-generated tools, issues in academic integrity abound. Artificial intelligence and plagiarism have emerged as the main threats to using content-generated AI tools in the scholarly literature. This study proposes to answer the following research questions:
            <jats:italic>What are Master’s students’ views of the use of content-generated tools? Why do Master's students use content-generated tools?</jats:italic>
            This qualitative descriptive phenomenological single case study contains interviews with nine Guyanese Master’s students completing their theses about their use and experiences using content-generated AI tools and their views on AI and plagiarism. These students were chosen based on non-probability purposive sampling. The researcher implemented six steps in qualitative data analysis. In vivo, descriptive, and evaluative coding were implemented with semantic and latent meanings considered. Deontology, utilitarianism, rational self-interest, and cultural relativism were linked to three components of the Theory of Planned Behavior when deductive coding was implemented. This study can inform policy development and implementation on AI and plagiarism.

While the proposed data governance framework is timely and important, I offer two provocations to invite critical reflection on the limits of the data-centric approaches to governing AI and digital societies more broadly. Drawing on the findings from the ERC INFO-LEG project, first, I argue that framing digital problems primarily in terms of data risks oversimplification of such problems, which are often complex socio-technical and political affairs. Second, I caution that data governance and the ensuing uncertainties of the boundaries of included data and groups can distract from the essence of the problems at hand, facilitating evasion strategies for powerful actors, for example, by navigating technical and legal complexity to their advantage. I advocate for more context-specific approaches to governing digital societies, where data governance may be part of the solution but not the starting point.</jats:p>"

Traditional CDSSs rely on unimodal data, which limits their predictive accuracy and coverage. The incorporation of MMAI holds promise for more accurate diagnosis, treatment optimization, and personalized patients care by synthesizing heterogeneous data sources. This narrative review explores the growing role of MMAI in improving diagnostic sensitivity, personalizing treatment, and improving healthcare delivery through the integration of heterogeneous data sources. It examines the evolution of MMAI technologies, such as large language models, large vision models, vision-language models, and large multimodal models, and their practical applications in clinical settings. The review also addresses key ethical, technical, and infrastructure challenges, such as data quality, model interpretability, bias, and system interoperability. Finally, it provides strategic recommendations for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers to promote responsible adoption of MMAI in healthcare. While recent developments show significant promise, addressing current limitations is essential to fully realize the transformative potential of MMAI in modern medicine.</jats:p>"

In this article, we explore these potentials in the context of military-themed videogames and their portrayals of weaponized artificial intelligence (AI). Within paradoxical videogame representations of AI weapons both as ‘insurmountable enemies’ that pose existential threats to humankind in narratives and as ‘easy targets’ that human protagonists routinely overcome in gameplay, we identify distortions of human–machine interaction that contradict real-world scenarios. These distortions revolve around videogames affording players enhanced human agency to dominate AI weapons to offer enjoyable gameplay, contradicting the same weapons being intended to diminish human agency on real-world battlefields. By leveraging the Actor-Network Theory concept of ‘translation’, we explain how these distorted portrayals of AI weapons are produced by entanglements between heterogeneous human and non-human actors that aim to make videogames mass-marketable and profitable. In so doing, we echo game studies research that calls for greater attention to the commercial and ludic dimensions of videogames so that international relations scholarship can better account for pop culture’s bounded abilities to impact public understandings and political realities. </jats:p>"

This paper identifies and assesses AI-related risks in smart libraries from a technostress perspective, proposing governance strategies to enhance service quality and provide a reference for smart library development. Using content analysis and technostress theory, potential risk sources of AI applications in smart libraries are analyzed across five dimensions: techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity, techno-insecurity, and techno-uncertainty. The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is then applied to assess causal relationships among risks, revealing two categories: technical-level risks (AI malfunction, emotional disconnection, AI misjudgement, algorithmic bias, and responsibility ambiguity) and societal-level risks (security threat, fairness challenges, regulatory ambiguity, copyright concern, and occupational maladaptation). Key findings highlight AI malfunction and misjudgment as driving risks, while regulatory ambiguity and occupational maladaptation are resultant risks. The paper proposes hierarchical risk governance strategies, including prioritizing high-driven risks, managing resultant risks, and dynamically adjusting adaptation rules.</jats:p>"

However, analyzing narratives to learn about their content is expensive in terms of time and money. Recently developed artificial intelligence–based tools may help ease the analysis process. This study explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) to facilitate narrative text analysis. The narratives were written by medical students on their observations and reflections on medical encounters in which bad news was delivered. These narratives are challenging for analysis due to their semi-structured nature and medical and emotional content. We compared a former analysis process done manually versus the ability of LLMs to analyze these narratives, across different categories, including contextual (e.g., demographics) and thematic analysis. Our results showed that the LLM effectively processed data and followed formatting requirements. However, the LLM’s performance varied across different categories, showing closer alignment with human analysis in straightforward categories (e.g., age), while struggling with more nuanced aspects of the narratives (e.g., assessing surprise). Ambiguities and complexities in the narratives posed significant challenges for the LLM, limiting its interpretive accuracy needed in such cases. The findings suggest that LLMs could complement human analysis, particularly in extracting explicitly mentioned contextual information, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the analysis process. The research highlights the need for further investigation into the capabilities of LLMs, pointing toward a future where the LLM and human qualitative researchers work in synergy to manage the demand for a timely and accurate narrative analysis.</jats:p>"

We show the intrinsic limits of the mechanistic myths in AI, from classical to Deep Learning techniques, and its relation to the human construction of sense. Human activities in a changing ecosystem – in their somatic and sensible dimensionalities proper to any living experiences – are at the core of our analysis. By this, we stress the key role of the knowing subject, far away from any allegedly objective big collections of data. The production of organized structures of physics, biology and in societal analysis will be compared and distinguished by trying to set on more robust grounds the constructive as well as the disruptive roles of entropic, negentropic, anti-entropic dynamics that are different concepts in different domains, to be handled with care: the use of machine learning and optimization methods as tools and models to analyse and manage human activities in view of their scientific and political ideology of technoscientific governance. They suppose that which they try to produce is objective, that is, standardized and controllable behaviours. In this dialogue we stress a mirror symmetry between the lack of theoretical interpretation of scientific data and the lack of democracy in this fiction of neutrality. Moreover, bad analogies constitute an obstacle to grasp the anteriority of biological and ecological constraints which enable and limit all artificial products of human intelligence. We will thus stress biological specificity, the role of normativity and constraints in evolution, of labour in structuring the human historical construction of sense by common activities. </jats:p>"

What they seem to mean by this is that chess, like the common fruit fly, is an accessible, familiar, and relatively simple experimental technology that nonetheless can be used productively to produce valid knowledge about other, more complex systems. But for historians of science and technology, the analogy between chess and drosophila assumes a larger significance. As Robert Kohler has ably described, the decision to adopt drosophila as the organism of choice for genetics research had far-reaching implications for the development of 20th century biology. In a similar manner, the decision to focus on chess as the measure of both human and computer intelligence had important and unintended consequences for AI research. This paper explores the emergence of chess as an experimental technology, its significance in the developing research practices of the AI community, and the unique ways in which the decision to focus on chess shaped the program of AI research in the decade of the 1970s. More broadly, it attempts to open up the virtual black box of computer software – and of computer games in particular – to the scrutiny of historical and sociological analysis. </jats:p>"

            stands as a pioneering scholar whose work traverses literacy studies, sociolinguistics, and digital learning. His theory of ‘Discourses’, defined as socially situated ways of being that integrate language, values, and practices, has fundamentally reshaped how educators and researchers conceptualize literacy beyond traditional print boundaries and into the domains of identity formation and social participation. As Mary Lou Fulton Presidential Professor Emeritus at Arizona State University, his interdisciplinary contributions span critical theory, video game-based learning, and digital literacies, offering nuanced perspectives on human cognition and engagement across contexts. This conversation explores his insights into the evolving nature of literacy in relation to his Discourse theory, particularly in light of recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) that are transforming notions of authorship, meaning-making, and literacy practices in contemporary society.

In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel “word-of-machine” effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

The system mainly integrates four application modules: psychological knowledge learning, psychological daily evaluation, psychological expert consultation and personal personalized management. The experiment shows that the artificial intelligence online expert consultation system designed in this paper can query daily psychological problems conveniently and quickly. At the same time, the treatment of human psychological problems can be realized through the intelligent online psychological counselling and the relief of psychological symptoms. The artificial intelligence online mental health education system has obvious practical value and social significance.</jats:p>"

Even though AI provides great advantage in application changes it is essential to remodel the system using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) design system. Also the standard sensing models provides appropriate monitoring values but huge size of sensors is considered as a major drawback. Thus two diverse problems are addressed in this research work where XAI has been integrated with micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) for solving the problems related to BFS applications. Further the data security has been enhanced as XAI is implemented with conviction managements and real time experiments are carried out by developing a unique application by integrating new mathematical designs. To validate the effectiveness of BFS application the developed model is tested with five scenarios which includes multiple parametric arrangements with interpretability process. The tested and compared outcomes with existing models indicates that XAI and MEMS provides inordinate improvements in terms of data impairments thus increasing the transparency of the projected system to an average 96%. </jats:p>
sage,Journalists as individual users of artificial intelligence: Examining journalists’ “value-motivated use” of ChatGPT and other AI tools within and without the newsroom,10.1177/14648849241303047,,Shangyuan Wu,Journalism,2024,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/14648849241303047,"<jats:p> ChatGPT and other AI applications have made the widespread use of artificial intelligence possible with their conversational interfaces and open accessibility – this “mainstreaming” of AI use has become concerning for news organizations as they grapple with the creation of appropriate AI-related guidelines and tools for their newsrooms. Even while such discussions are ongoing, the cultural shift among journalists has already begun. This paper highlights the role of journalists not simply as agents working within the confines of news organizations, but as actors with individual agency to enact change. Their use of AI has already gained significant momentum, with or without newsroom oversight and direction. This paper, supported by field theory, uses in-depth interviews with journalists and editors to uncover how journalists are themselves using AI in their day-to-day work, and how they ensure their values of “good journalism” are not compromised. Results show that journalists are already personally using AI in numerous tasks across all the stages of news production, namely in news gathering, news writing and presentation, news editing, and news promotion, and have three strategies to maintain their practice of “good journalism”. These results prompt the paper’s proposition of a new “value-motivated use” perspective to summarize journalistic adoption of AI – that it is the journalistic values that motivate their increased use of AI, as well as the values that motivate their limitations of this use; journalists will use the technology only to the extent that it aligns with the values of their profession. </jats:p>"

The approximate principal component analysis method is used to segment the color image and smooth the image denoising; The linear gray-scale transformation is applied to the color image to enlarge the smaller gray-scale space to the larger gray-scale space according to the linear relationship and obtain the edge information of the color image; The artificial intelligence technology is used to locate the edge sub-pixel of the image to complete the edge color difference detection of the color image. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed method is about 98%, and the detection effect is good, which is feasible.</jats:p>"

These conditions argue for conservative approaches to AI that focus on cultivating and sustaining public trust. We use the extended Brunswik lens model as a framework to illustrate the distinctions between policy analysis and decision making as we have traditionally understood and practiced them and how they are evolving in the current AI context along with the challenges this poses for the use of trustworthy AI. We offer a set of recommendations for practices, processes, and governance structures in government to provide for trust in AI and suggest lines of research that support them. </jats:p>"

They are trained on billions of words of text scraped from the internet. They generate text responses to text inputs. They have transformed the public awareness of artificial intelligence, bringing on reactions ranging from astonishment and awe to trepidation and horror. They have spurred massive investments in new tools for drafting texts, summarizing conversations, summarizing literature, generating images, coding simple programs, supporting education, and amusing humans. Experience with them has shown them likely to respond with fabrications (called ""hallucinations"") that severely undermine their trustworthiness and make them unsafe for critical applications. Here, we will examine the limitations of LLMs imposed by their design and function. These are not bugs but are inherent limitations of the technology. The same limitations make it unlikely that LLM machines will ever be capable of performing all human tasks at the skill levels of humans.</jats:p>"

The article explores the role of multimodal large models in image processing and OCR of ancient books. We discuss and exemplify how to use Large Language Models for intelligent information processing of ancient texts and explore combining prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), supervised fine-tuning, LangChain, and other techniques to improve performance in ancient text mining and applications. This article also looks forward to the broad prospect of intelligent agent technology combined with the Large Language Model in the innovative application of ancient book revitalization. The research focuses on digitizing ancient books, intelligent processing of ancient texts, and intelligent application of ancient book revitalization. It demonstrates the feasibility, advancement, and creativity of the application of generative AI and its derivative technologies in the field of computational humanities, especially in the field of ancient book preservation, to provide intelligent solutions for the dissemination of traditional thought and culture, from the perspective of the whole process of the technology of digital humanities and computational humanities research. The article also gives examples of the intelligent application of AI in the restoration of ancient books and the annotation of ancient texts. Although Large Language Models demonstrate transformative potential in advancing the field of ancient text research toward intelligent analysis, there remain certain limitations. This article points out their shortcomings in areas such as knowledge completion for ancient texts, understanding emotions and cultural nuances, as well as ethical and accountability issues. It emphasizes the need for a more balanced perspective on the role that generative AI plays in the exploration and utilization of cultural heritage.</jats:p>"

While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.</jats:p>"

            Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce the
            <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">AI Uncertainty Principle</jats:italic>
            , a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the trade-off between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.

The arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 brought AI into the public spotlight with a dramatic new capability. A user can how engage in a fluent conversation in ordinary language with a computer. Suddenly many people want to know what AI is, whether it is safe, and what benefits it might bring. Artificial intelligence is defined to be a collection of machines and algorithms that perform tasks normally considered to require human cognition. Opinions and claims about the possible benefits and risks of AI are all over the map. In response to the confusion, the Ubiquity editors are launching a symposium on AI. It will be a series of about two dozen articles on the many aspects of AI and its applications. The series will be synthesized into the ""Ubiquity Report on Artificial Intelligence,"" which is intended to be an authoritative and trustworthy summary of present and future AI.</jats:p>"

Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.</jats:p>"

This progress did not occur in a vacuum. AI emerged against a rich background of technologies from computer science and ideas about intelligence and learning from philosophy, psychology, logic, game theory, and cognitive science. We sketch out the enabling technologies for AI. They include search, reasoning, neural networks, natural language processing, signal processing and computer graphics, programming and conventional software engineering, human-computer interaction, communications, and specialized hardware that provides supercomputing power. Beyond these technologies is the notion of Artificial General Intelligence that has or exceeds the capabilities of the human brain. Currently this is completely aspirational and is not expected to be possible before 2025, if ever. Artificial Intelligence is based on a variety of technologies, none of which seek to emulate human intelligence.</jats:p>"

This impact, however, has mostly considered ICT as a tool suitable for tasks with low complexity. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), there are examples of AI use for more complex street-level work. Examples include cases where AI is used for assessing eligibility for social benefits, predictive policing models, automated grading, and diagnostics in healthcare. While these applications demonstrate potential benefits, they also introduce new challenges related to privacy, accountability, corporatization and alienation of street-level work, and client service experiences. This article is a critical reflection on the street-level potential of AI in providing public services. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on AI's impact in street-level work by emphasizing both the potential benefits and risks associated with AI integration in frontline service provision. While AI may mitigate some limitations of human decision-making (e.g., subjectivity, inconsistency, and bias), it can also introduce challenges that require careful consideration (e.g., lack of transparency, data-driven bias, and limited contextual adaptation). By critically reflecting on AI's street-level potential, this article calls for a balanced approach to AI adoption in street-level work.</jats:p>"
